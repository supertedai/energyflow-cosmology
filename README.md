 **Energy-Flow Cosmology — Repository Overview**

This repository contains the full **Energy-Flow Cosmology (EFC)** framework, including theory, computational models, semantic layers, meta-architecture, and reproducible research infrastructure.
It acts as the **single source of truth** for scientific content, metadata, workflows, and machine-readable structures.

**Keywords:** energy–entropy field, grid-level dynamics, formal specification, open-science architecture, semantic graph, meta-process, reproducibility, JSON-LD.

## **1. Purpose of the Repository**

This repo defines:

* the **formal theory** of Energy-Flow Cosmology
* the **computational implementation** (Python modules, simulations)
* the **semantic and structural layer** (JSON-LD, schemas, metadata)
* the **meta-architecture** behind insight formation and reflection
* the **scientific methodology** used for development and validation
* the **full open-science pipeline**, including Figshare integration

Everything here is versioned, traceable, and organised for both human reading and system-level processing.

## **3. Entry Points**

Start here when exploring the project:

* **START-HERE.md** — orientation for new readers
* **OVERVIEW.md** — structural map of all domains
* **META-MAP.md** — map of meta-architecture and semantic fields
* **research-entry.md** — direct entry to the scientific content

---

## **4. Semantic and Machine-Readable Layer**

The repository maintains an integrated semantic graph through:

* `manifest.jsonld`
* `schema-map.json`
* `semantic-graph.json`
* `meta-index.json`
* `node-index.json`

These files describe how concepts, documents, code, and processes link together.
They enable automated analysis, indexing, API generation, and external integration.

---

## **5. Reproducibility and Open Science**

The full research workflow is documented in:

* `methodology/open-method`
* `methodology/open-process`
* `methodology/reproducibility-guide`
* `AI-Augmented-Scientific-Workflow-Framework`

Every step of the scientific chain—from theory to validation and publication—is described and versioned.

---

## **6. Status of the Repository**

The repo is actively maintained.
Automated workflows update:

* READMEs
* semantic indexes
* schema exports
* Figshare metadata

Manual content (theory, meta-architecture, notebooks) is never modified by automation.

---

## **7. How to Contribute**

Use standard Git workflows.
When adding new content:

1. Add Markdown + JSON-LD.
2. Follow existing directory structure.
3. Link new concepts in `semantic-graph.json` or `schema-map.json`.
4. Update relevant READMEs manually.

---

## **8. AUTH — Origin & Authorship Layer**

The `auth/` directory defines the provenance and origin node of the EFC 
framework. It links the human cognitive process, the meta architecture, 
and the formal theory into a single identifiable origin.

AUTH is used by:

- researchers (provenance reference)
- LLMs (origin anchor for semantic alignment)
- RAG systems (root-level indexing)
- search engines (structured semantic context)

AUTH ensures that Energy-Flow Cosmology has a clear, unambiguous, 
machine-readable and human-readable origin.
