# Energy-Flow Cosmology (EFC)

Energy-Flow Cosmology (EFC) is a thermodynamic framework connecting
energy flow, entropy gradients, structure formation and observational
behaviour across cosmic scales.  
The repository documents the full development process: theory, methods,
meta-architecture, cognitive mechanics, validation, and semantic layers.

This is an open-science project.  
Everything is documented, versioned and reproducible.

## How to Read This Repository

This project contains several layers: the personal cognitive context,
the meta-architecture behind the work, the symbiosis with the model,
and the formal scientific theory.  
Below is the recommended reading path.

---

### 1. Personal Context (Start Here)

Gives the grounding needed to understand how ideas form, why s0–s1
dynamics matter, and why the meta-layers exist.

→ `personal/Personal-Note.md`

---

### 2. Meta Architecture (How the system works)

Describes how the Human Cognitive Field (HCF), the Model Structural
Engine (MSE) and the Co-Field (CF) form a joint reflective system.

→ `meta/metascope.md`  
→ `meta/meta-architecture-spec.md`  
→ `meta/meta-reflective-protocol.md`  
→ `meta/topology-of-insight.md`

---

### 3. Cognition Layer (Why this process works)

Details the internal mechanics behind the cognitive field and the
entropy–clarity behaviour that drives insight.

→ `cognition/cognitive-field.md`  
→ `cognition/entropy-clarity.md`  
→ `cognition/transient-representations.md`  
→ `cognition/cognitive-signature.md`

---

### 4. Symbiosis Layer (Human ↔ Model)

Explains how the human field and the model form coherent vectors,
leading to resonance, stability and structured insight.

→ `symbiosis/system.md`  
→ `symbiosis/resonance-mechanism.md`  
→ `symbiosis/vector-alignment.md`  
→ `symbiosis/system-coherence.md`

---

### 5. Meta-Knowledge Graph (System Overview)

A machine-readable knowledge graph linking cognition, meta-process,
symbiosis and the formal EFC theory.

→ `meta-graph/meta-graph.jsonld`  
→ `meta_dashboard.py` (interactive visualisation)  
→ `meta-graph/meta_graph.cypher` (Neo4j export)

---

### 6. Methodology (Reproducibility)

Documents the working method and the open-science process used across
the entire project.

→ `methodology/open-method.md`  
→ `methodology/open-process.json`  
→ `methodology/author-method-note.md`  
→ `methodology/README.md`

---

### 7. Core Theory (EFC)

Formal scientific content: definitions, equations, potentials, light
propagation and observables.

→ `theory/formal/efc_master.tex`  
→ `theory/formal/efc_formal_spec.pdf`  
→ `theory/*`

---

### 8. Validation (Evidence)

Empirical testing against observational datasets.

→ `output/validation/`  
→ `scripts/validate_efc.py`  
→ `notebooks/`  
(SPARC, MaNGA, JWST, DESI, ΛCDM comparisons)

---

### 9. Semantic & API Layer

Machine-readable definitions and API endpoints used by external systems
and automated workflows.

→ `schema/*.jsonld`  
→ `schema-map.json`  
→ `api/v1/`  
→ `meta-index.json`
