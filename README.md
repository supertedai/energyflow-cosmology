# Energy-Flow Cosmology — Repository Overview

This repository contains the full **Energy-Flow Cosmology (EFC)** framework, including theory, computational models, semantic layers, symbiotic runtime architecture, and reproducible research infrastructure.

It functions as the **single source of truth** for:

- scientific content  
- metadata and semantic structure  
- APIs and machine interfaces  
- knowledge-graph memory  
- vector-memory (RAG)  
- cognitive/meta processes  
- open-science workflows and DOI integration

**Keywords:** energy–entropy field, grid-level dynamics, formal specification, symbiotic runtime, knowledge graph, vector-graph retrieval, open-science architecture, JSON-LD, reproducibility.

## 1. Purpose of the Repository

This repository defines:

- the **formal scientific theory** (EFC)
- the **runtime system** that supports cognitive workflows (Symbiosis)
- the **computational implementation** (Python modules)
- the **semantic and structural layer** (JSON-LD, schemas, graph)
- the **meta-architecture** used for reasoning and reflection
- the **complete open-science pipeline**, including DOI and Figshare integration

Everything is versioned, traceable, machine-readable, and reproducible.

## 3. Entry Points

Recommended starting points:

- **START-HERE.md** — orientation  
- **OVERVIEW.md** — map of all domains  
- **META-MAP.md** — meta-architecture overview  
- **research-entry.md** — scientific entry point  
- **meta/symbiosis/README.md** — Symbiosis runtime entry

---

## 4. Semantic and Machine-Readable Layer

The entire repository is indexed through:

- `manifest.jsonld`
- `schema-map.json`
- `semantic-graph.json`
- `meta-index.json`
- `node-index.json`

These files describe how concepts, documents, metadata, code and processes connect.  
They support automated indexing, graph reasoning, API validation and external integration.

---

## 5. Reproducibility and Open Science

The complete research workflow is documented under:

- `methodology/open-method`
- `methodology/open-process`
- `methodology/reproducibility-guide`
- `AI-Augmented-Scientific-Workflow-Framework`
- Symbiosis runtime integration

Every stage—from theory → computation → insight → publication—is versioned and reproducible.

---

## 6. Status

The repository is actively maintained.

Automated workflows handle:
- semantic indexes
- schema exports
- metadata updates
- Figshare synchronisation

Manual scientific content is curated with care and is never overwritten by automation.

---

## 7. Authorship & Provenance

The `auth/` directory defines the origin, provenance and cognitive root of the EFC and Symbiosis framework.

Used by:
- researchers  
- search engines  
- citation frameworks  
- LLMs  
- RAG systems  

This ensures unambiguous authorship and origin.
