## Overview

Energy-Flow Cosmology (EFC) is a **unified thermodynamic framework** describing the universe as a continuous flow of energy guided by entropy gradients.  
It provides an alternative to the ΛCDM model by replacing dark matter and dark energy with measurable thermodynamic dynamics.

The theory is structured into three domains:

| Domain | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| **EFC-S (Structure)** | Explains how entropy gradients generate geometry and the cosmic web. |
| **EFC-D (Dynamics)** | Describes expansion, gravity, and time as emergent properties of energy flow. |
| **EFC-C (Cognition)** | Extends the same thermodynamic logic to awareness and information systems. |

## Repository Structure

| Folder | Purpose |
|--------|----------|
| `/schema` | JSON-LD and structured data for schema.org integration. |
| `/docs` | Articles and theoretical modules (Markdown or HTML). |
| `/figshare` | DOI mappings, preprints, and metadata exports. |
| `/website` | Web-ready HTML templates from energyflow-cosmology.com. |
| `/images` | Diagrams, figures, and conceptual graphics. |
| `/data` | Observational and validation datasets (e.g. DESI, JWST). |
| `/scripts` | Utility scripts for automation and content generation. |

---

## Current Focus

1. Integrate all published Figshare works (DOI-linked) into `/docs`.  
2. Expand `/schema` to include complete schema.org markup for each concept.  
3. Automate synchronization between website and GitHub for version control.  
4. Prepare future machine-readable knowledge graph (Neo4j, JSON-LD export).
