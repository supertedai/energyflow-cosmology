# 📘 Jupyter Notebooks — *Energy-Flow Cosmology (EFC)*

Interactive notebooks demonstrating and validating the **Energy-Flow Cosmology (EFC)** model against the standard **ΛCDM** cosmological framework.

---

## 📂 Contents

| Notebook | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|
| **EFC_Baseline.ipynb** | Baseline simulation showing how the EFC expansion rate \(H\) evolves with entropy \(S\) and energy flow \(E_f\). |
| **EFC_vs_LCDM.ipynb** | Comparative analysis between EFC and ΛCDM. Both expansion functions are plotted together, highlighting where thermodynamic dynamics diverge from the standard cosmology. |
| *Upcoming* `EFC_Entropy_Test.ipynb` | Boundary tests for \(S \rightarrow 0\) (singularity) and \(S \rightarrow 1\) (equilibrium), exploring the thermodynamic limits of the model. |

## 🔬 Scientific Context

The **Energy-Flow Cosmology (EFC)** model derives cosmic expansion as a function of **entropy gradients** and **energy-flow potential**.
It treats expansion as an *emergent thermodynamic process* rather than a geometric one.

In contrast, the **ΛCDM** model relies on the empirical Friedmann relation:

[
H(z) = H_0 \sqrt{ \Omega_m (1 + z)^3 + \Omega_\Lambda }
]

where:

* ( H_0 ) is the present-day Hubble constant
* ( \Omega_m ) is the matter density parameter
* ( \Omega_\Lambda ) is the dark-energy density parameter

The **EFC vs ΛCDM** notebook demonstrates where these formulations diverge and how **entropy (S)** in EFC can act as a thermodynamic analogue to **redshift (z)** in ΛCDM.

## 🧩 Interpretation

* **EFC curve (blue):** Expansion rate increases with entropy — energy dispersion drives emergent spacetime expansion.
* **ΛCDM curve (red):** Expansion rate decreases with entropy (inversely with redshift).
* The crossover between the curves marks where both frameworks predict similar effective (H).
