## Abstract
This document compiles the **empirical evidence** supporting the hypothesis that **energy flow** governs the evolution and structure of spacetime.  
Across cosmic scales—from the CMB to galactic rotation and gravitational lensing—observations demonstrate that **energy flow is measurable, consistent, and structurally determinative**.  
These results reinforce the **Energy-Flow Cosmology (EFC)** model, which treats energy flow and entropy as the dual parameters defining the universe’s thermodynamic architecture.

## 1. Empirical Support for Energy Flow’s Impact on Space-Time

### 1.1 Redshift Data
Observations of galactic redshift confirm accelerated cosmic expansion.  
This behavior reflects a **redistribution of energy flow** across low-density regions, consistent with entropy-driven divergence.

### 1.2 Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)
The CMB shows temperature and energy-density fluctuations (δT/T ≈ 10⁻⁵) that align with **energy-flow differentials** in the early universe.  
These patterns indicate that energy flow influenced primordial structure formation, long before matter condensation.

### 1.3 Gravitational Lensing
The bending of light around massive objects demonstrates that **energy flow shapes local curvature**.  
Gravitational fields emerge as thermodynamic distortions in the energy-flow field, not as static geometric deformations.

### 1.4 Galactic Clusters
Cluster-temperature distributions and galaxy-motion data reveal **localized energy flows** maintaining equilibrium within massive systems.  
These intra-cluster energy circulations support the EFC prediction of entropic self-stabilization.

## 2. Energy Flow at the Universe’s Edges

### 2.1 Cosmic Voids
Void regions display active **energy inflow** balancing global matter distribution.  
Energy flow through void boundaries contributes to large-scale homogeneity without invoking dark energy.

### 2.2 Haloes and Dark Matter Interactions
The edges of galactic halos show energy-flow patterns that **stabilize visible matter** and mimic dark-matter halos—an effect explainable by entropy-regulated tension within the Grid-Higgs framework.

### 2.3 Universal Expansion Boundaries
The universe’s accelerating expansion reveals large-scale energy-flow dynamics compensating for entropy’s natural pull toward dispersion.  
This aligns with the EFC view that expansion is the macroscopic expression of energy redistribution.

## 3. What Observations Suggest

1. **Consistency Across Scales:**  
   From quantum fluctuations to galaxy clusters, energy flow operates by the same thermodynamic logic at all levels.

2. **Energy–Structure Link:**  
   Observations consistently show that energy flow *sustains and shapes* cosmic structure, confirming its role as the primary organizing mechanism.

3. **New Frontiers:**  
   Edge-of-universe measurements, CMB refinements, and dark-energy surveys provide new opportunities to test the energy-flow hypothesis.

## 4. Next Steps and Methodology
Future exploration focuses on:
- Correlating **Planck** and **JWST** data to map entropy gradients.
- Refining **energy-flow field equations** against CMB anisotropy power spectra.
- Applying **Euclid** and **LSST** datasets to verify entropy-driven expansion models.

---

## 5. Conclusion
Observational data increasingly support a cosmological model in which **energy flow drives spacetime dynamics**.  
Redshift acceleration, lensing effects, and CMB anisotropies are unified under one thermodynamic mechanism.  
This redefines cosmology as a science of **energy redistribution**, where gravity and expansion are two aspects of the same flow process.
