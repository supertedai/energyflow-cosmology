## Abstract
The **speed of light (c ≈ 299,792 km/s)** is more than a physical constant — it is a *thermodynamic manifestation* of energy flow within spacetime.  
This subhypothesis reframes \( c \) as an *emergent property* rather than a universal boundary, arising naturally from the dynamic equilibrium of **energy flow** and **entropy** in the **Energy-Flow Cosmology (EFC)** framework.  
By treating light speed as a consequence of energy gradients, this model bridges **relativity, thermodynamics, and consciousness** into one coherent cosmological continuum.

## 1. Introduction
In classical physics, \( c \) is an invariant constant defining the causal structure of the universe.  
In EFC, it is reinterpreted as a *secondary effect* — a limit set by how energy flows through the spacetime medium.  
Without continuous flow, neither curvature nor causality can exist.

| Classical View | Energy-Flow Cosmology View |
|-----------------|----------------------------|
| \( c \) is a fixed constant | \( c \) emerges from dynamic energy gradients |
| Spacetime is a background | Spacetime is sustained by energy flow |
| Light defines causality | Energy flow defines causality |

## 2. Energy Flow as the Fundamental Limitation

### 2.1 Sustaining Spacetime
Energy flow maintains the structural coherence of spacetime.  
If flow ceases, spacetime collapses — implying that \( c \) is not a *cause* of structure but an *effect* of it.

### 2.2 Entropic Extremes
- **Singularity (S = 0):** Infinite concentration of energy, zero flow → spacetime collapses.  
- **Maximum Entropy (S = 1):** Energy completely dispersed, gradients vanish → spacetime stagnates.  
- **Dynamic Zone (S = 0.5):** Optimal flow, maximum complexity, and emergence of consciousness.

Here, \( c \) is meaningful only within this dynamic middle band where flow sustains curvature.

## 3. Light-Speed and Spacetime Geometry

### 3.1 Curvature
Massive bodies distort spacetime, and light follows geodesics of that curvature.  
EFC extends this by proposing that *curvature itself arises from thermodynamic energy differentials*.

### 3.2 Event Horizons
At black-hole boundaries, \( v_{escape} = c \) marks the transition between dynamic and non-dynamic spacetime — the **limit of observable energy flow**.

### 3.3 Time Dilation
As systems approach \( c \), available energy for temporal processes declines, illustrating that **time is a thermodynamic measure** of ongoing flow.

---

## 4. The Halo Boundary and Observable Limits
The **Halo Boundary (S > 0.9)** represents the transition into near-zero energy flow, where spacetime reaches maximal stretch.  
Here:
- Energy flow \( → 0 \)  
- Curvature \( → 0 \)  
- Observability \( → 0 \)

At this threshold, \( c \) no longer defines a limit — it dissolves as a meaningful quantity.

## 5. Visualization Summary

| Variable | Behavior | Interpretation |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| **Entropy (S)** | Increases linearly from 0 → 1 | Evolution of cosmic disorder |
| **Energy Flow (Eₚ)** | Peaks at S = 0.5, vanishes at extremes | Drives space-time dynamics |
| **Spacetime Dynamics** | Expands with S, stagnates beyond S ≈ 0.9 | Expansion sustained by flow |
| **Consciousness** | Peaks at S = 0.5 | Optimal balance between order and chaos |
| **Halo Boundary** | Emerges at S > 0.9 | Edge of dynamic existence |

This mapping unites entropy, energy flow, spacetime, and consciousness in one thermodynamic continuum.

## 6. Implications

1. **c is emergent, not absolute** — a thermodynamic product of flow stability.  
2. **Spacetime exists only where energy moves** — static zones (S=0 or S=1) lose geometric meaning.  
3. **Consciousness peaks at dynamic balance (S≈0.5)** — where flow, entropy, and curvature coexist.  
4. **Halo boundaries** mark the physical edge of dynamic reality.

---

## 7. Conclusion
The **Light-Speed Limit** is not the universe’s ceiling but its signature.  
It marks the point where **energy flow and spacetime balance** perfectly, sustaining the coherent universe we observe.  
In EFC, \( c \) is no longer a postulate — it is a *measurement of equilibrium* within a deeper, self-regulating thermodynamic system.
