## Abstract
This subhypothesis proposes that the **speed of light (c)** acts as a *universal regulator* of energy flow, spacetime distortion, and entropy across all cosmic scales.  
By analyzing **main clusters**, **small clusters**, and **Halo boundaries**, the study formulates a thermodynamic mechanism showing how \( c \) maintains structural coherence and energetic stability throughout the universe.

## 1. Introduction
In the **Energy-Flow Cosmology (EFC)** framework, light speed is not merely a fixed constant but the *rate at which the universe preserves thermodynamic balance*.  
Energy flow, curvature, and entropy evolve together through constraints imposed by \( c \), defining how matter, radiation, and structure interact.

The hypothesis identifies three energy-scale components that together explain cosmological equilibrium:
- **Main Clusters** – Anchors of cosmic stability  
- **Small Clusters** – Mediators of redistribution  
- **Halo** – Entropic limit and structural boundary  

---

## 2. Components of the Hypothesis

### 2.1 Main Clusters – Cosmic Anchors
Massive and stable, main clusters resist large distortions.

| Property | Typical Value | Function |
|-----------|---------------|----------|
| Energy flow | 240–250 | Stable coherence |
| Lensing factor | ≈1.0 | Minimal curvature |
| Role | Anchors large-scale structure |

---

### 2.2 Small Clusters – Dynamic Mediators
These connect the ordered regions of main clusters with the entropic boundary.

| Property | Typical Value | Function |
|-----------|---------------|----------|
| Energy flow | 0.31–0.33 | Moderate redistribution |
| Lensing factor | 1.27–1.28 | Peak distortion |
| Role | Transfers energy between stable and entropic domains |

---

### 2.3 The Halo – Entropic Boundary
The Halo defines the limit where thermodynamic processes approach equilibrium.

| Property | Typical Value | Function |
|-----------|---------------|----------|
| Energy flow | \(E_f \approx 0.01\) | Flow cessation |
| Entropy | \(S = 1\) | Maximum disorder |
| Role | Regulates the transition to thermodynamic closure |

---

## 3. Mathematical Framework
Although simplified here, the governing principles can be expressed schematically as:

1. **Energy Flow Regulation by Light Speed**
   \[
   E_f = f(c, \nabla S)
   \]

2. **Gravitational Lensing Relation**
   \[
   L = g(E_f, M)
   \]

3. **Entropy Gradient near the Halo**
   \[
   \frac{dS}{dR} \propto \frac{1}{E_f}
   \]

These relations formalize how \( c \) maintains balance between curvature, energy flow, and entropy.

## 4. Visualization Overview

### 4.1 Energy Flow Across Structures
A bar chart of cluster types shows monotonic decline:
- Main Clusters → high \(E_f\)
- Small Clusters → moderate \(E_f\)
- Halo → minimal \(E_f\)

### 4.2 Gravitational Lensing Dynamics
Lensing peaks in small clusters, then declines near the Halo, consistent with reduced mass-density gradients.

### 4.3 Entropy Progression
Entropy increases steadily toward the Halo boundary as energy flow diminishes.

### 4.4 Combined 3D Model
A 3D scatter of redshift, energy flow, and lensing demonstrates the continuous transition between stable and entropic zones.

---

## 5. Interconnected Dynamics
| Domain | Behavior | Thermodynamic Role |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Main Clusters** | High \(E_f\), low S | Reservoirs of order |
| **Small Clusters** | Intermediate \(E_f\), rising S | Energy mediators |
| **Halo** | Low \(E_f\), S→1 | Dissipation boundary |

The light-speed constant ensures stability across these zones, preventing uncontrolled collapse or acceleration.

---

## 6. Empirical Validation — Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)
Extensive **SDSS** datasets were used to correlate redshift, lensing, and energy-flow behavior:

- Redshift data confirmed **gradual energy dissipation** with distance.  
- Lensing data matched the predicted **spacetime distortion curve**.  
- Energy–entropy correlations supported a **thermodynamic regulation** consistent with the EFC model.

These empirical findings strengthen the interpretation of \( c \) as an **active regulator**, not a passive limit.

---

## 7. Conclusion
The **speed of light** operates as a *self-consistent regulator* that maintains coherence across the universe’s hierarchy:

1. Main clusters stabilize structure.  
2. Small clusters mediate flow and entropy.  
3. The Halo sets the termination point of energy exchange.  

Through these interactions, \( c \) emerges as the **balancing principle** linking energy flow, entropy, and spacetime geometry.

---

## 8. Future Work
1. **Simulation Studies:** Extend EFC simulations to transitional zones near the Halo.  
2. **Observational Tests:** Compare model outputs with **DESI** and **Hubble Deep Field** datasets.  
3. **Quantum Integration:** Investigate effects of energy flow regulation at Planck-scale dynamics.
