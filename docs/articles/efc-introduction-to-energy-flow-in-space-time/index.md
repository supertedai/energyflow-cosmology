## Abstract
This document introduces the foundational concept of **energy flow** as the dynamic process that sustains the structure of **space-time**.  
Rather than treating spacetime as a static geometric container, the Energy-Flow Cosmology (EFC) framework describes it as a **thermodynamic continuum**—an evolving field maintained by constant redistribution of energy and entropy.  
Without this flow, neither stability nor structure could emerge in the universe.

## 1. What is Energy Flow in Space-Time?
Energy flow refers to the **movement and redistribution of energy** across the spacetime manifold.  
This process balances the opposing influences of **gravity, entropy, and expansion**—the three thermodynamic forces defining cosmic evolution.

### Key Roles:
1. **Stabilizing Spacetime**  
   Energy flow provides the framework that keeps the dimensions of time and space coherent.  

2. **Driving Evolution**  
   It fuels the expansion of galaxies, the birth of stars, and the growth of structure throughout the universe.  

3. **Coupling with Entropy**  
   The interaction between energy flow and entropy enables localized complexity while maintaining global balance.

## 2. Why Energy Flow Matters
The concept unifies multiple phenomena traditionally seen as separate:
- **Cosmic Expansion:** an expression of outward energy redistribution.  
- **Gravitation:** a localized gradient of energy density.  
- **Entropy Increase:** a measure of equilibrium-seeking dynamics within spacetime.  

Energy flow thereby becomes the **common driver** behind the evolution of both structure and perception.

## 3. Connections to the Main Hypothesis
This work directly supports the broader **Energy-Flow Cosmology** model, linking energy, entropy, and awareness as interdependent aspects of one thermodynamic process.  
It forms the conceptual bridge to:
- [How Does Energy Flow Sustain Space-Time?](https://www.magnusson.as/how-does-energy-flow-sustain-space-time)  
- [Energy Flow and the Sustenance of Space-Time (Technical Documentation)](https://www.magnusson.as/documentation)

## 4. Implications
1. **Cosmological:**  
   Energy flow defines spacetime curvature dynamically — not geometrically.  
2. **Physical:**  
   Conservation and dissipation coexist through continuous transformation.  
3. **Philosophical:**  
   Reality emerges from energetic equilibrium rather than material permanence.

## 5. Next Steps
Further exploration of:
- The mathematical field equations describing entropy-driven curvature.  
- Observational correlations using CMB temperature gradients.  
- Conceptual links between energy flow and perception of the present (“the Now”).
