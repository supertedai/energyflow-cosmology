## Abstract
The **Grid Model** introduces an entropic and dynamic theory of gravity where gravitational effects are emergent phenomena produced by **entropy-regulated energy flow**.  
By replacing dark matter and dark energy with measurable thermodynamic interactions, this model aligns cosmological observations with a single unified principle: *spacetime stability arises from energy flow constrained by entropy gradients*.  
Comprehensive analyses of **JWST**, **SDSS**, and **Planck** datasets show strong empirical support, reproducing observed rotation curves, gravitational lensing, and CMB anisotropies.

## 1. Introduction
Modern ΛCDM cosmology successfully describes large-scale structure but struggles with persistent anomalies:  
- The **Hubble tension** between local and early-universe expansion rates.  
- The **nature of dark matter** and **dark energy**.  
- **CMB deviations** at high multipoles and unexpected galactic rotation behavior.  

The **Grid Model** addresses these by postulating that **entropy and energy flow** govern the dynamics and curvature of spacetime, rendering dark matter and dark energy unnecessary.  
Gravity becomes a macroscopic manifestation of entropic regulation within a dynamic energy grid.

## 2. Fundamental Principles

### 2.1 Energy Flow and Spacetime Stability
Energy flow \( E_f \) sustains spacetime coherence.  
Entropy \( S \) increases linearly as energy flow decreases:

\[
E_f(S) = E_0 (1 - S)
\]

- Near singularities (\( S = 0 \)): energy concentration halts flow → local curvature (black holes).  
- Near maximal entropy (\( S = 1 \)): dispersion halts flow → large-scale expansion.  

Thus, both collapse and expansion are boundary states of the same thermodynamic continuum.

---

### 2.2 Emergent Speed of Light
The speed of light \( c \) is not an immutable constant but emerges from local energy-flow coherence:

\[
c(S) = c_0 [1 - \alpha (S - S_0)]
\]

At intermediate \( S \), \( c \) appears constant; deviations occur only near \( S = 0 \) or \( S = 1 \).  
This explains slight redshift inconsistencies and small variations in gravitational-wave arrival times.

---

### 2.3 The Halo as a Structural Stabilizer
Cosmic halos act as **dynamic regulators** of energy flow — stabilizing structures and maintaining equilibrium across entropy gradients.  
They replace dark matter halos by managing **local energy retention** and **entropy distribution**.  
This yields flat rotation curves and coherent lensing without invoking exotic matter.

---

## 3. Empirical Validation

### 3.1 JWST and SDSS Observations
- JWST high-redshift galaxies exhibit **mass decline trends** consistent with reduced energy density at high \( S \).  
- SDSS and eFEDS surveys confirm **entropy-dependent gravitational attenuation** at z ≈ 0.2–0.5.

### 3.2 Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)
Predicted anisotropy deviation of ~7% at ℓ > 1000, matching Planck and ACT data.  
These deviations reflect deeper entropy dynamics in the cosmic grid.

### 3.3 Gravitational Waves
LIGO observations show \( Δc_g / c < 10^{-15} \), consistent with the Grid Model’s confinement of entropy-induced wave-speed variation to extreme environments (black-hole mergers, dense clusters).

---

## 4. Simulation and Numerical Validation

### 4.1 Cosmological Simulations
Numerical experiments confirm:
- Linear \( S \)-increase ↔ exponential \( E_f \)-decline.  
- Reproduction of rotation curves **without dark matter**.  
- Lensing strength \( ∝ (1 - S) \), decreasing in high-entropy voids.

### 4.2 Thermodynamic Damping Factor
A damping parameter \( γ(S) \) aligns CMB and large-scale structure data:

\[
γ(S) = γ_0 e^{-\beta S}
\]
ensuring smooth entropy–energy transition consistency with Planck and JWST data.

---

## 5. Dark Matter and the Bullet Cluster
An **entropic interaction term** explains Bullet Cluster observations without particle dark matter:

\[
F_{eff} = λ ∇S
\]
producing the required lensing distribution through grid-stress differentials.  
No exotic mass component is necessary.

---

## 6. Conservation Laws
The Grid Model integrates energy and momentum conservation within a Lagrangian framework:

\[
\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_{E_f} + \mathcal{L}_{entropy} + \lambda (∇S)
\]
ensuring dynamic equilibrium and total energy constancy.

---

## 7. Discussion and Implications
- **Gravity** arises from thermodynamic regulation — not a fundamental force.  
- **Dark matter/energy** emerge as apparent effects of entropic tension.  
- **CMB** marks a steady-state energy interface between vacuum and spacetime.  
- The Grid Model bridges thermodynamics, field theory, and observational cosmology in one coherent structure.

---

## 8. Future Research
1. Validate through **JWST** and **LSST** weak-lensing datasets.  
2. Develop high-resolution **Grid–Higgs simulations** for dynamic curvature.  
3. Extend framework to **quantum gravity coupling** and information entropy limits.

---

## 9. Conclusion
The Grid Model provides a **thermodynamically consistent** and **empirically testable** replacement for ΛCDM.  
Gravity, cosmic expansion, and structure formation emerge from one law:  
\[
\nabla \cdot [k(S)\nabla E_f] = \frac{\partial V(E_f, S)}{\partial S}
\]
This unites spacetime dynamics, entropy growth, and energy recycling within a single entropic field.
