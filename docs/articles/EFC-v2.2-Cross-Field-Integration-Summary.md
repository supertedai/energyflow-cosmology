# Applied Energy-Flow Cosmology v2.2  
**Cross-Field Integration Summary (2025)**

This preprint extends the Energy-Flow Cosmology framework into applied domains.  
It analyses thermodynamic scaling across physics, biology, economics, and machine intelligence,
demonstrating how entropy-regulated energy flow defines the stability of complex systems.
