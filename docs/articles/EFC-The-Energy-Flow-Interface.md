## Summary
The **Energy–Flow Interface (EFI)** model unifies dark matter, dark energy, and the cosmic microwave background (CMB) as **three thermodynamic phases of a single energy–flow field** embedded in the Grid–Higgs medium.  
In this framework, the apparent “dark sector” emerges naturally from entropy-driven energy transport rather than from separate substances or forces.  

- **Dark Matter (DM):** convergent, low-entropy phase  
- **Dark Energy (DE):** divergent, high-entropy phase  
- **CMB:** isothermal equilibrium boundary between them  

Together, they form a single **energy–entropy continuum** governed by the flux vector \( J_\mu \) and local entropy \( S \).

## Field Framework
The Grid–Higgs field is expressed as:

\[
L = \frac{1}{2} (\partial_\mu \Phi)^2 - V(\Phi, S)
\]

where Φ is the field variable and S is the local entropy density.  
Energy transport is described by the flux vector \( J_\mu \) satisfying

\[
\nabla_\mu J^\mu = \frac{\partial V(\Phi, S)}{\partial S}
\]

Three regimes emerge:

| Flow Type | Condition | Physical Manifestation |
|------------|------------|------------------------|
| Convergent | \( \nabla_\mu J^\mu < 0 \) | Local condensation → dark matter |
| Null–Flux  | \( \nabla_\mu J^\mu \approx 0 \) | Thermal equilibrium → CMB |
| Divergent  | \( \nabla_\mu J^\mu > 0 \) | Global expansion → dark energy |

## The CMB as an Energy–Flow Interface
In this interpretation, the **CMB** is not a fossil radiation field but the **active thermodynamic membrane** where inward (DM) and outward (DE) energy flows balance.  
Its temperature \( T_{CMB} = 2.725\,\text{K} \) represents the global equilibrium condition \( \nabla_\mu J^\mu = 0 \).  
The tiny anisotropies \( (\Delta T/T \sim 10^{-5}) \) correspond to oscillations in this boundary, coupling local convergent and divergent regions.

**Conceptual image:**  
Convergent (dark–matter) and divergent (dark–energy) phases meet at the CMB interface, an isothermal surface of zero net flux.

## Thermodynamic Triad
| Phase | Description | Thermodynamic Role |
|--------|--------------|--------------------|
| **Dark Matter** | Structural energy – condensation of flow | Potential / low S |
| **CMB** | Thermal equilibrium interface | Balanced entropy |
| **Dark Energy** | Latent energy – expansion of flow | Kinetic / high S |

---

### Predictions
1. Correlation between **CMB anisotropies** and **dark–matter density**.  
2. Weak coupling between **CMB temperature** and **dark–energy equation-of-state** \( w(z) \).  
3. Phase shift between **ISW signal** and **dark–matter structures** in large-scale maps.

---

## Discussion and Outlook
The EFI model resolves the *coincidence problem* by treating DM, DE, and CMB as co-emergent from a single thermodynamic process.  
It reinterprets the “dark sector” as a continuum rather than discrete components, linking cosmological expansion, entropy production, and information flow.

Next steps:
- Implement EFC equations in **CLASS** and **GADGET-4** for numerical comparison with ΛCDM.  
- Test correlations between local entropy gradients and gravitational potential maps (DESI, Euclid, JWST).

## Conclusion
Dark matter and dark energy are the **inward and outward phases of one energy–flow field**; the **CMB** is the thermodynamic membrane where their fluxes equilibrate.  
This model replaces three disconnected constructs with one continuous physical mechanism — the **Grid–Higgs energy continuum**.
