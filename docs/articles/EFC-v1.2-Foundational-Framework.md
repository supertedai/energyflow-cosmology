# Energy-Flow Cosmology v1.2  
**Foundational Framework and Cross-Field Continuity**

This preprint formalizes the covariant, non-equilibrium thermodynamic field framework extending General Relativity.
It introduces the scalar energy-flow potential Ef as the generator of entropy-driven curvature and structure,
provides proofs of mathematical well-posedness and Lyapunov stability, and links the framework to
informational and biological domains through the free-energy correspondence.
