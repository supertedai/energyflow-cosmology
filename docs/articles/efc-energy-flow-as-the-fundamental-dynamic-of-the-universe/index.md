## Abstract
This sub-hypothesis presents **energy flow (Eₚ)** as the **fundamental dynamic** of the universe.  
It sustains spacetime, regulates entropy, and influences the speed of light.  
The framework replaces the cosmological constant (Λ) of the ΛCDM model with a **dynamic energy-flow field**, providing explanations for dark energy, Hubble-tension, and temperature anisotropies in the **Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)**.

## 1. Introduction
Energy flow defines the **thermodynamic state of spacetime**.  
When \(E_f \to 0\), quantum fluctuations dominate, causing instability.  
This model integrates relativity, thermodynamics, and quantum theory into a single system describing the evolution of entropy, curvature, and light propagation.

---

## 2. Principles

### 2.1 Energy Flow and Spacetime
Spacetime stability depends on continuous energy flow:  
\[
\nabla \cdot [k(S)\nabla E_f] = \frac{\partial S}{\partial V}(E_f, S)
\]
where \(k\) is a constant related to mean energy density.  
If \(E_f \to 0\), curvature destabilizes — producing voids and structural decay.

### 2.2 Entropy and Cosmic Dynamics
Entropy \(S\) increases over time while energy flow weakens:
\[
E_f(S) = E_0(1 - S)
\]
When \(S \to 1\), energy flow approaches zero, affecting halo boundaries and intergalactic voids.

### 2.3 Speed of Light
The local value of \(c\) arises from energy gradients:
\[
c = c_0 \left( 1 - \alpha \frac{\Delta E}{\rho_E} \right)
\]
where \(\alpha\) is an empirical constant, \(\Delta E\) is energy-density gradient, and \(\rho_E\) is local energy density.  
Thus, **light speed emerges as a thermodynamic function**, not a fixed universal constant.

---

## 3. Quantitative Examples

### 3.1 Variations in Light Speed
Simulations show that in galaxy halos, the effective \(c\) may vary by up to **0.1 %**, consistent with small-scale deviations under extreme conditions.

### 3.2 Dark Energy
Dark energy corresponds to **minimal energy flow** in high-entropy regions:
\[
E_f \to 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \text{apparent accelerated expansion.}
\]

### 3.3 Hubble Tension
Local \(H_0\) values exceed global estimates due to regional differences in entropy production and energy flow — linking the Hubble-tension to **thermodynamic non-uniformity**.

## 4. Observations and Testability

| Phenomenon | Prediction | Observational Test |
|-------------|-------------|--------------------|
| **Gravitational lensing** | Time-delay anomalies in halos where \(E_f\) is weak | Compare JWST lensing magnification patterns |
| **Redshift in voids** | Non-linear redshift profiles in low-flow regions | Analyze DESI DR2 data |
| **CMB anomalies** | Smoother temperature distributions in high-entropy regions | Compare Planck & Simons Observatory results |

These measurable effects link thermodynamic variation directly to cosmological observables.

## 5. Simulation Insights

### 5.1 Energy Flow Evolution
Energy flow decreases **exponentially** as entropy increases:
\[
E_f(t) \propto e^{-\beta S}
\]

### 5.2 Light-Speed Variations
Effective \(c/c_0\) changes linearly with energy density in simulated halos and voids.  
Low-energy environments correlate with delayed light propagation and stronger gravitational time dilation.

### 5.3 Combined Dynamics
Simulations demonstrate:
- Quadratic decrease of \(E_f\) with \(S\).  
- Peak curvature at intermediate \(S\).  
- Linear reduction of effective \(c\) with redshift.  
These findings support the hypothesis that **energy flow, curvature, and entropy are mutually coupled**.

## 6. Discussion

### 6.1 Replacement of Λ in ΛCDM
The Λ term is replaced by a **non-equilibrium thermodynamic variable \(E_f\)**, resolving inconsistencies between constant vacuum energy and evolving spacetime.

### 6.2 Addressing Observational Anomalies
- **Hubble Tension:** Localized \(E_f\) variations alter expansion rates.  
- **CMB Smoothing:** Energy-flow decay explains near-uniform temperature fields.  
- **Dark Energy Interpretation:** Apparent acceleration arises from entropy-induced weakening of \(E_f\).

### 6.3 Empirical Integration
Observations from DESI, JWST, and Planck can test the quantitative predictions of this model through:
- Correlated entropy-energy mapping,  
- Light-travel-time measurements, and  
- Redshift distribution asymmetries.

---

## 7. Counterarguments and Responses
- **Constancy of c:** Laboratory constancy remains valid since variations occur only in extreme cosmic environments.  
- **Energy–Momentum Conservation:** Preserved via local compensation in spacetime geometry.  
- **Observational Limits:** Requires precision spectroscopy and high-resolution CMB data to verify sub-percent light-speed shifts.

---

## 8. Conclusion
Energy flow (Eₚ) serves as the **active field variable** governing universal structure, entropy evolution, and light propagation.  
It bridges relativity and thermodynamics, offering measurable pathways to explain anomalies traditionally attributed to dark energy and dark matter.  
The hypothesis situates the universe as a **self-regulating, energy-balanced system** where flow — not expansion alone — sustains existence.
