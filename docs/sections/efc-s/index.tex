\subsection*{Overview}

EFC-S describes structure formation as the emergence of stable configurations
in the entropy field. Halos, nodes, and filaments arise from local curvature
in $S(r)$.

\subsection*{Local Entropy Well}

A halo is modeled as:

\[
S(r) = S_0 \, e^{-r/r_s},
\]

where $r_s$ is the scale length.

\subsection*{Effective Density}

The effective density follows directly from entropy curvature:

\[
\rho_{\text{eff}}(r) = \nabla^2 S(r).
\]

\subsection*{Rotation Curve Prediction}

The predicted rotation velocity is:

\[
v(r) = \sqrt{ r \, \partial_r \Phi_E(r) },
\]

leading to dark-matter–free rotation curve fits for SPARC/MaNGA galaxies.
