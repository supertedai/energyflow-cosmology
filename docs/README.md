# **Documentation**

This directory contains all human-readable documentation for the Energy-Flow Cosmology (EFC) project. It provides a clear overview of theory, methods, meta-architecture, and supporting materials. The structure is designed to align with the semantic layers of the repository and the public metadata endpoints.

---

## **Purpose**

The `docs/` directory collects all explanatory material that complements the source files in:

* `theory/`
* `meta/`
* `schema/`
* `methodology/`
* `api/`
* `papers/`

It focuses on clarity, structure, and accessibility.

---

## **Contents**

The directory typically includes:

* **Readable summaries**
  High-level explanations of EFC concepts, structure, and terminology.

* **Guides and overviews**
  Simple introductions to the theory, the meta-architecture, and the workflow behind the project.

* **Process documentation**
  Notes on methodology, reflection, and the development model used in EFC.

* **Paper overview**
  Links to scientific papers, formal specifications, and DOI-assigned documents.

* **Supporting diagrams or explanations**
  Visual or textual helpers that clarify how parts of the system fit together.

## **Role in the Repository**

`docs/` acts as the entry point for human readers.
It bridges:

* **formal content** (LaTeX, ontology, schema)
* **semantic content** (JSON-LD, TTL)
* **conceptual content** (theoretical and meta-theoretical)

The files here complement the machine-readable layers exposed through GitHub Pages.

---

## **Usage**

* Keep documentation concise and structured.
* Update summaries when theory or meta-architecture changes.
* Ensure that each major document links to its semantic counterpart.
* Store human-focused explanations here rather than in code directories.
* Maintain a consistent tone and structure across files.

## **Relation to Other Directories**

`docs/` works together with:

* **`theory/`** — formal definitions and equations
* **`meta/`** — high-order structure, cognition, and process layers
* **`schema/`** — semantic definitions for machines
* **`papers/`** — full scientific documents
* **`api/`** — interfaces for programmatic access

As a whole, this directory provides the narrative and explanatory layer of EFC.
