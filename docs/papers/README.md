 **Papers Directory**

This directory contains all formal written outputs associated with Energy-Flow Cosmology (EFC). It includes scientific papers, technical specifications, LaTeX documents, and conceptual drafts.

The directory is divided into two main domains:

* **EFC theory** — what the model describes.
* **Meta-process papers** — how the model is developed.

Both domains are versioned and linked to the semantic structure of the repository.

## **Contents**

The directory includes:

* **Scientific papers**
  Completed or near-finished documents covering theory, models, and physical interpretation.

* **Technical specifications**
  LaTeX files with definitions, notation, mathematical structures, and parameter tables.

* **Drafts and preprints**
  Work-in-progress documents under evaluation or expansion.

* **Meta-level papers**
  Writing on methodology, cognitive structure, reflection, and process architecture behind EFC.

* **DOI-linked documents**
  Papers assigned Figshare DOIs, stored here for traceability.

## **Purpose**

The goal of this directory is to:

* keep all written research artifacts in a single structured location
* separate theory (EFC) from development process (meta)
* maintain version history and provenance
* support reproducible science through consistent documentation
* link human-readable papers to the machine-readable metadata system

---

## **Usage**

* Add new papers under clear filenames.
* Keep LaTeX sources and generated PDF/HTML outputs together.
* Link each document to its corresponding semantic node (`index.jsonld`, ontology classes, methodology entries).
* Update Figshare DOIs when new versions are released.
* Maintain short abstracts for each major paper.

## **Relation to the Repository**

This directory works together with:

* `theory/` — formal definitions and models
* `meta/` — process architecture and methodology
* `schema/` — semantic definitions
* `api/` — machine interfaces
* `figshare/` — DOI metadata

It forms the **human-facing layer** of the EFC knowledge system.
