# EFC — Formal Specification

This directory contains the formal specification of the Energy-Flow
Cosmology framework.  
It defines the mathematical objects, field equations, structural
relations, and thermodynamic constraints that form the core of the EFC
model.  
The formal spec serves as the canonical reference for notation, symbols,
field interactions, and governing principles.
