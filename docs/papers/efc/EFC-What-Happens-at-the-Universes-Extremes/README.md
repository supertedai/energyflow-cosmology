# EFC — What Happens at the Universe’s Extremes?

This directory contains the paper examining the behaviour of energy,
entropy, structure, and spacetime near the extreme boundaries of the
universe within the Energy-Flow Cosmology framework.  
The paper discusses conditions approaching S = 0 (maximal order) and
S = 1 (maximal disorder), and how these entropic limits shape cosmic
dynamics, energy propagation, structure stability, and the emergence or
collapse of information.
