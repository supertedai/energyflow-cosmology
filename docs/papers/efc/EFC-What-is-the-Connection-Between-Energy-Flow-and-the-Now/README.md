# EFC — What is the Connection Between Energy Flow and the Now?

This directory contains the paper examining how the experience of “the
Now” emerges from energy flow, entropy gradients, and temporal ordering
within the Energy-Flow Cosmology framework.  
The paper discusses how directionality, state transitions, and local
entropy conditions shape the perception and physical meaning of the
present moment.
