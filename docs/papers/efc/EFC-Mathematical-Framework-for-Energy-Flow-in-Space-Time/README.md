# EFC — Mathematical Framework for Energy Flow in Space-Time

This directory contains the paper presenting the mathematical foundations
for energy flow, entropy gradients, and grid-level resistance in the
Energy-Flow Cosmology framework.  
The paper outlines the core equations, field definitions, and
relationships that formalise how energy propagation and structure emerge
in a thermodynamic spacetime.
