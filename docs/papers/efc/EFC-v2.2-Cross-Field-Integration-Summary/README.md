# EFC — v2.2 Cross-Field Integration Summary

This directory contains the v2.2 Cross-Field Integration Summary for the
Energy-Flow Cosmology project.  
It outlines how the thermodynamic, structural, dynamical, entropic, and
informational components of EFC integrate into a unified cross-field
architecture.  
This version focuses on coupling, interfaces, and the multi-level
mapping that links Grid, Entropy, Energy Flow, and Information fields.

This summary complements the v2.1 Complete Edition and the v2.1 Modular
Synthesis.
