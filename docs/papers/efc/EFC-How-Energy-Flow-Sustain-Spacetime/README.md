# EFC — How Energy Flow Sustains Spacetime

This directory contains the paper explaining how continuous energy flow
maintains the structural, geometric, and dynamical properties of spacetime
within the Energy-Flow Cosmology framework. The paper outlines how
entropy gradients, resistance fields, and distributed flows provide the
underlying support for spacetime stability and large-scale structure.
