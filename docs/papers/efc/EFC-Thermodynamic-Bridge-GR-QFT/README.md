# EFC — The Thermodynamic Bridge Between GR and QFT

This directory contains the paper outlining the thermodynamic bridge
between General Relativity (GR) and Quantum Field Theory (QFT) within the
Energy-Flow Cosmology framework.  
The paper explains how entropy gradients, energy flow, and grid-level
resistance create a unifying layer that connects curvature (GR) and
quantised excitation behaviour (QFT) through thermodynamic structure.
