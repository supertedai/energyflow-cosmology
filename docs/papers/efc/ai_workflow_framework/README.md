# AI Workflow Framework — Energy-Flow Cosmology

This directory contains the paper describing the AI-augmented workflow
framework used in the Energy-Flow Cosmology project.  
It outlines the roles, boundaries, data flow, validation structure,
versioning, and machine-integration steps that define how AI contributes
to structuring, stabilising, and documenting the scientific process.

The framework separates:
- human theoretical reasoning  
- AI structural assistance  
- reproducible computational workflow  
- semantic and metadata generation
