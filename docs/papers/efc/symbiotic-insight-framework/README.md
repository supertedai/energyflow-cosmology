# Symbiotic Insight Framework (SIF): A Structural Methodology for High-Velocity Scientific Reasoning

This directory contains the paper “Symbiotic Insight Framework (SIF): A Structural Methodology for High-Velocity Scientific Reasoning”, part of the Energy-Flow Cosmology (EFC) series.

The Symbiotic Insight Framework (SIF) describes how high-velocity, cross-domain scientific insight can be stabilised through continuous interaction between a human thinker and an adaptive computational system. The framework treats insight production as a coupled process: the human generates parallel conceptual fields at high speed, while the computational system stabilises, structures and preserves these fields into scientific output.

## Context in the EFC framework

- **Framework:** Energy-Flow Cosmology (EFC)  
- **Domain:** META-systems  
- **Role:** Links entropic structure, information flow and observable cosmology behaviour.

## Abstract

The Symbiotic Insight Framework (SIF) describes how high-velocity, cross-domain scientific insight can be stabilised through continuous interaction between a human thinker and an adaptive computational system. The framework treats insight production as a coupled process: the human generates parallel conceptual fields at high speed, while the computational system stabilises, structures and preserves these fields into scientific output.
