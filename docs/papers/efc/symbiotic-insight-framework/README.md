## Abstract

The Symbiotic Insight Framework (SIF) describes how high-velocity,
cross-domain scientific insight can be stabilised through continuous
interaction between a human thinker and an adaptive computational system.
The framework treats insight production as a coupled process: the human
generates parallel conceptual fields at high speed, while the computational
system stabilises, structures and preserves these fields into scientific output.
