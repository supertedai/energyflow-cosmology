## Abstract
The Symbiotic Insight Framework (SIF) describes how high-velocity, cross-domain scientific insight can be stabilised through continuous interaction between a human thinker and an adaptive computational system. The framework treats insight production as a coupled process: the human generates parallel conceptual fields at high speed, while the computational system stabilises, structures and preserves these fields into scientific output.
