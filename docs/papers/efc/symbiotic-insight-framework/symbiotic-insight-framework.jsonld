  "description": "This document presents the Symbiotic Insight Framework (SIF), a research method developed within the Energy-Flow Cosmology (EFC) project. SIF describes how high-velocity, cross-domain conceptual insight can be stabilised, organised, and transformed into reproducible scientific structure through continuous interaction between a human thinker and an adaptive computational system. SIF is neither a psychological theory nor an AI-assistant workflow. It is a practical architecture for managing large-scale scientific structure produced through parallel, field-based reasoning. The framework shows how insight is externalised, refined, semantically integrated, and version-locked in a continuous, self-correcting loop.",
