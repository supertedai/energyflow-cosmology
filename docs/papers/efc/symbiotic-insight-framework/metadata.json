  "description": "The Symbiotic Insight Framework (SIF) describes how high-velocity,\ncross-domain scientific insight can be stabilised through continuous\ninteraction between a human thinker and an adaptive computational system.\nThe framework treats insight production as a coupled process: the human\ngenerates parallel conceptual fields at high speed, while the computational\nsystem stabilises, structures and preserves these fields into scientific output.",
