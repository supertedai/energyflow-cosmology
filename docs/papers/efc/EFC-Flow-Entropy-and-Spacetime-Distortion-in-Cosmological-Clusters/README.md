# EFC — Flow, Entropy, and Spacetime Distortion in Cosmological Clusters

This directory contains the paper describing how energy flow (Ef),
entropy gradients, and grid-level resistance produce observable
spacetime distortions in cosmological clusters. It outlines how lensing,
dynamics, temperature asymmetries, and cluster morphology emerge from
thermodynamic processes.
