# EFC — Why is Light Speed a Cosmic Limit?

This directory contains the paper explaining why the speed of light
appears as a universal limit within the Energy-Flow Cosmology framework.
The paper outlines how entropy gradients, grid resistance, and the
thermodynamic structure of spacetime collectively impose an upper bound
on propagation speed and dynamic transitions.
