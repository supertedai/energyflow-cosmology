# EFC — CMB Thermodynamic Gradient

This directory contains the paper describing the thermodynamic gradient
interpretation of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) in
Energy-Flow Cosmology. It explains how entropy flow, energy gradients,
and grid-level structure produce the observed CMB pattern without
invoking dark matter or dark energy.
