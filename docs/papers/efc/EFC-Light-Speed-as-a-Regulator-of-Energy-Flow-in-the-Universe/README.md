# EFC — Light Speed as a Regulator of Energy Flow in the Universe

This directory contains the paper discussing how the speed of light acts
as a regulating boundary for energy propagation, stability, and dynamic
structure within the Energy-Flow Cosmology framework.  
The paper outlines how light speed emerges from entropy–energy
interaction and how it constrains, shapes, and stabilises universal
behaviour across scales.
