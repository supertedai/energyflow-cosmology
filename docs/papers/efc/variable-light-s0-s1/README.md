# Variable Light Speed and the s₀ / s₁ Entropic States

This directory contains the EFC paper:

**“Variable Light Speed and the s₀ / s₁ Entropic States”**

Core idea:

- The speed of light is treated as an emergent, entropic property.
- Two coarse-grained states structure the system:
  - `s₀`: low-entropy, high-coherence, near-ground configuration.
  - `s₁`: active flow, higher entropy, structured curvature.
- The balance between `s₀` and `s₁` sets the effective light speed `c_eff`
  as part of the Energy-Flow Cosmology (EFC) framework.
