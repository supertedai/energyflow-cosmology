  "description": "In Energy-Flow Cosmology (EFC), the effective speed of light is not a primitive constant but an emergent propagation limit determined by the entropic state of the grid. Two fundamental entropic phases---a low-entropy constraining state ($s_0$) and a high-entropy dissipative state ($s_1$)---govern the information capacity, local curvature, and energy-flow geometry. This paper provides a formal description of variable light speed as a function of the entropic gradient, derives a minimal model for ",
