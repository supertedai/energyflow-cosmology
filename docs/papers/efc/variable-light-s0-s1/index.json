  "summary": "In Energy-Flow Cosmology (EFC), the effective speed of light is not a primitive constant but an emergent propagation limit determined by the entropic state of the grid. Two fundamental entropic phases---a low-entropy constraining state ($s_0$) and a high-entropy dissipative state ($s_1$)---govern th",
