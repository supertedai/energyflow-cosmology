  "summary": "In Energy-Flow Cosmology (EFC), the effective speed of light is not a primitive constant but an emergent propagation limit determined by the entropic state of the grid. Two fundamental entropic phases---a low-entropy constraining state (s₀) and a high-entropy dissipative state (s₁)---govern the info",
