  "description": "In Energy-Flow Cosmology (EFC), the effective speed of light is not a primitive\nconstant but an emergent propagation limit determined by the entropic state of\nthe grid. Two fundamental entropic phases---a low-entropy constraining state\n($s_0$) and a high-entropy dissipative state ($s_1$)---govern the information\ncapacity, local curvature, and energy-flow geometry. This paper provides a\nformal description of variable light speed as a function of the entropic\ngradient, derives a minimal model for $c_{\\mathrm{eff}}(S)$, and introduces the\ncollapse mechanisms at both ends of the spectrum that shape observational\nhorizons and redshift behaviour.",
