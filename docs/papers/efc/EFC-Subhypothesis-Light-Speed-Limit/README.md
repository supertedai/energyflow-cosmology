# EFC — Subhypothesis: Light Speed Limit

This directory contains the paper presenting the subhypothesis that the
speed of light acts as a thermodynamic limit emerging from the interplay
between the entropy field, the energy-flow field, and the grid’s
resistance structure within the Energy-Flow Cosmology framework.  
The paper outlines how this limit arises naturally from non-equilibrium
dynamics and why it functions as a boundary for propagation, stability,
and universal structure.
