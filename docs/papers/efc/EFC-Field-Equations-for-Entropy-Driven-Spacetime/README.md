# EFC — Field Equations for Entropy-Driven Spacetime

This directory contains the paper presenting the proposed field equations
of Energy-Flow Cosmology: a formulation where spacetime structure and 
dynamics arise from entropy gradients, energy flow, and grid-level 
resistance rather than curvature alone.
