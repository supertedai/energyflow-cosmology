# EFC — Grid-Higgs Paradigm Shift

This directory contains the paper describing how the Grid-Higgs model
reframes mass, inertia, and spacetime interaction as emergent properties
of energy flow, entropy gradients, and grid-level resistance. It outlines
the conceptual and physical implications of replacing particle-based mass
generation with a thermodynamic field-interaction model.
