# EFC — Observational Evidence for Entropy in Cosmic Evolution

This directory contains the paper reviewing observational signatures that
support an entropy-driven model of cosmic evolution within the
Energy-Flow Cosmology framework.  
The paper discusses empirical patterns across structure formation,
temperature distributions, galactic dynamics, and cosmic background
signals that align with entropy-gradient behaviour.
