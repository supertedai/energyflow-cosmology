# EFC — Hypothesis: Universe as an Energy-Driven System

This directory contains the paper proposing that the universe behaves as an
energy-driven system where structure, dynamics, and evolution emerge from
continuous energy flow interacting with entropy gradients and grid-level
resistance fields. The paper outlines the principles that support a
non-equilibrium, thermodynamically driven cosmological model.
