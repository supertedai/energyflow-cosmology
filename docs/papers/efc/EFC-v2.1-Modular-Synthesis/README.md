# EFC — v2.1 Modular Synthesis

This directory contains the v2.1 Modular Synthesis paper, which presents
the modular decomposition of the Energy-Flow Cosmology framework.
It outlines how EFC separates into structural, dynamical, entropic, and
informational modules that can be analysed, validated, or extended
independently while still maintaining a consistent global architecture.

This version builds upon and complements the v2.1 Complete Edition.
