# EFC — Master Specification

This directory contains the master specification of the Energy-Flow
Cosmology framework.  
It is the canonical, authoritative, and complete reference for the
theory.  
All terms, definitions, mappings, field interactions, equations,
interfaces, and structural logic originate here.

The master spec integrates:
- thermodynamic foundations  
- entropy, grid, and energy-flow fields  
- spacetime behaviour  
- dynamic laws  
- structural architecture  
- cognitive and informational layers where relevant  
- cross-field consistency rules  

All other EFC papers, modules, and tools reference this document.

**Included files**
- PDF (authoritative master)
- Markdown (mirrors PDF)
- JSON-LD metadata for semantic systems
- Local schema for validation
- Machine index for automated harvesters
