# EFC — Master Specification (v1 Archive)

This directory contains the archived v1 master specification of the
Energy-Flow Cosmology framework.  
This version represents the earliest complete formulation of the theory,
including initial field definitions, conceptual structure, and primary
thermodynamic foundations.

The v1 archive is preserved for:
- historical reference  
- reproducibility  
- validation of theory development  
- comparison with v2.x and later specifications  

All newer work supersedes this version, but it remains an essential part
of the EFC development record.
