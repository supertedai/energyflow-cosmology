# EFC — Integrated Hypothesis: Time and Entropy

This directory contains the paper presenting the integrated hypothesis
that time emerges from entropy gradients and energy-flow directionality
within the Energy-Flow Cosmology framework. The paper outlines how
temporal ordering, causality, and structural evolution arise from the
interaction between entropy increase and the grid’s resistance dynamics.
