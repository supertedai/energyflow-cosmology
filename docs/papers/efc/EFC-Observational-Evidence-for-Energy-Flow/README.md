# EFC — Observational Evidence for Energy Flow

This directory contains the paper reviewing the observational indicators
of large-scale and local energy flow across the universe within the
Energy-Flow Cosmology framework.  
The paper outlines empirical signatures in galaxies, clusters,
background radiation, and anisotropic structures that support a
continuous-flow cosmological model.
