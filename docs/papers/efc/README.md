# EFC Papers — Energy-Flow Cosmology

This directory contains all papers, editions, formal specifications, and
supporting documents for the Energy-Flow Cosmology (EFC) framework.  
Each subdirectory includes a complete package with:
- PDF (authoritative)
- Markdown (searchable)
- JSON-LD metadata
- Local schema
- Machine index
- Citation file

The papers are grouped into conceptual, structural, observational, and
versioned categories.  
They form the documented progression of EFC from the first specification
to the unified v2.x architecture.

## Purpose of This Directory
This collection provides:
- a stable scientific record  
- version-controlled theory development  
- references for external researchers  
- machine-readable metadata for LLMs and automated systems  
- complete provenance for the evolution of the EFC framework  

All subdirectories follow the same internal structure for consistency,
clarity, and automated semantic indexing.
