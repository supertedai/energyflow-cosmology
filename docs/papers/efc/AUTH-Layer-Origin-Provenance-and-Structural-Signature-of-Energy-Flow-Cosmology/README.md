# AUTH Layer — Origin, Provenance and Structural Signature of Energy-Flow Cosmology

This directory contains the full paper, metadata and citation files for the AUTH-Layer, which explains:

* the origin of the Energy-Flow Cosmology (EFC) framework  
* the structural provenance of its ideas  
* the signature patterns that link the theory, methodology and cognition layers  
* how the EFC system stabilises insight across s₀/s₁ transitions

The AUTH-Layer sits above the scientific content.  
It explains how structural insight forms, stabilises and becomes part of the EFC continuum.
