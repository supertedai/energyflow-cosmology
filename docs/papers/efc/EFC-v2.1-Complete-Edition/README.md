# EFC — v2.1 Complete Edition

This directory contains the v2.1 Complete Edition of the
Energy-Flow Cosmology framework.  
It includes the expanded, consolidated, and refined formulation of EFC,
integrating structure, dynamics, entropy behaviour, grid interactions,
field mappings, and the full conceptual architecture into a unified,
version-controlled specification.

This edition supersedes the v1.x foundational series and reflects the
matured theory as used in current documentation, software, and the
semantic graph.
