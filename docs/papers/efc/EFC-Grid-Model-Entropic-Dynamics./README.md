# EFC — Grid Model for Entropic Dynamics

This directory contains the paper describing how entropic dynamics emerge
from the interaction between the Grid field, the entropy field \(S\),
and the energy-flow field \(E_f\). The model explains how local and
global structure form through gradients, resistance, and distributed
energy propagation in the EFC framework.
