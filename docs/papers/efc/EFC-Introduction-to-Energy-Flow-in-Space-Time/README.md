# EFC — Introduction to Energy Flow in Space-Time

This directory contains the introductory paper explaining how energy flow
acts as the fundamental driver of structure, motion, and information
propagation in spacetime within the Energy-Flow Cosmology framework.  
The paper provides an accessible overview of the core principles, fields,
and interactions that define EFC’s thermodynamic basis.
