## Abstract
This paper presents Symbiosis, a human--AI co-reflection architecture designed to support long-horizon thinking, traceable theory development, and structured cognitive work across extended timescales. The system integrates large language models (LLMs) with a hybrid memory substrate consisting of a knowledge graph (Neo4j), a vector database (Qdrant), and a unified API layer that binds reflection, retrieval, and logging into one operational loop. Unlike conventional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, Symbiosis is built not only for document search, but for persistent reasoning, hypothesis tracking, and metacognitive feedback over time. The architecture enables a human user to externalize thinking into a verifiable structure, reducing cognitive load while increasing coherence, continuity, and historical depth of reasoning. The system has been developed and stress-tested through multi-year theoretical work on Energy-Flow Cosmology (EFC), a thermodynamic cosmology framework that challenges standard interpretations of dark matter, dark energy, and spacetime dynamics. EFC serves as an empirical and practical case for evaluating Symbiosis as a real-world, high-complexity cognitive scaffold. This paper documents the method, architectural choices, and current capabilities of Symbiosis as a research infrastructure for reflective human--AI interaction. It does not claim finality or standardization. Instead, it establishes a reproducible, inspectable foundation for long-term co-reasoning systems that can be iterated and extended by others.
