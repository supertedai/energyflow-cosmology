# EFC — The Energy-Flow Interface

This directory contains the paper introducing the concept of the
Energy-Flow Interface: the boundary layer where the entropy field,
grid field, and energy-flow field interact to produce observable
structure, dynamics, and information transfer in the Energy-Flow
Cosmology framework.  
The paper outlines how this interface regulates transitions, stabilises
patterns, and forms the bridge between local processes and
large-scale behaviour.
