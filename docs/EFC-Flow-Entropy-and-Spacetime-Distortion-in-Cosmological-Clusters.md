## Abstract
This study examines how **energy flow (Eₚ)** and **entropy (S)** evolve across **cosmological clusters**, revealing a coherent relationship between redshift, spacetime distortion, and gravitational lensing.  
By analyzing three clusters from the **SDSS DR18** dataset, the findings confirm that energy flow decreases with increasing redshift while entropy grows steadily — validating the presence of **stable Halo structures** with consistent thermodynamic properties.  
The analysis integrates observational data with the **Energy-Flow Cosmology (EFC)** model.

## 1. Introduction
Cosmic structures exhibit organized dynamics governed by thermodynamic principles.  
In galaxy clusters, **energy flow declines** with cosmic distance, while **entropy increases**, reflecting the universe’s non-equilibrium evolution.  
This study tests the hypothesis that **Halos** act as stabilizers within these systems, moderating spacetime distortion and sustaining energy coherence despite large-scale expansion.

---

## 2. Methodology
Three cosmological clusters were analyzed from **SDSS DR18**, within defined ranges of right ascension (RA), declination (Dec), and redshift (z).  
Energy flow, entropy, and spacetime distortion were modeled using an optimized EFC-based approach.

### Optimized Model Parameters
| Parameter | Symbol | Result | Interpretation |
|------------|---------|--------|----------------|
| Baseline energy | E₀ | 1.001 | Stable at low z |
| Energy exponent | n | −0.33 | Energy flow decreases with z |
| Distortion factor | α | −0.059 | Spacetime curvature correction |
| Lensing factor | L | 0.636 | Brightness amplification |

## 3. Results

### 3.1 Energy Flow
Energy flow decreases with redshift, consistent with the thermodynamic model.  
Initial deviations were explained by lensing and distortion corrections.

### 3.2 Entropy
Entropy increases with redshift, confirming universal energy dispersion.  
Across all clusters:
- Cluster 1 → S = 0.738 ± 0.014 S  
- Cluster 2 → S = 0.738 ± 0.012 S  
- Cluster 3 → S = 0.727 ± 0.009 S  

### 3.3 Halo Stability
Uniform entropy growth and consistent energy flow confirm **Halo stability**.  
Halos act as thermodynamic regulators maintaining internal equilibrium despite cosmic expansion.

### 3.4 Spacetime Distortion & Lensing
- Distortion (\(α = −0.059\)) dampens local energy flow.  
- Lensing (\(L = 0.636\)) amplifies observed luminosity and offsets redshift discrepancies.

## 4. Discussion

### 4.1 Energy Flow Dynamics
Decreasing energy flow reflects cosmological energy dissipation.  
Lensing explains brightness anomalies at higher redshifts, aligning observation and theory.

### 4.2 Entropy and Thermodynamic Consistency
Entropy’s steady growth demonstrates **macro-scale thermodynamic coherence**, supporting the EFC view that expansion and structure formation are dual aspects of energy redistribution.

### 4.3 Combined Distortion Effects
Spacetime distortion and lensing are interdependent:
- Distortion modifies local curvature.  
- Lensing amplifies the distant signal, revealing flow gradients otherwise undetectable.

## 5. Visualizations
1. **Energy Flow vs. Redshift:** monotonic decline, consistent with EFC model.  
2. **Entropy vs. Redshift:** smooth increase indicating thermodynamic regularity.  
3. **Spacetime & Lensing Effects:** near-constant α and L values across clusters.

---

## 6. Conclusions
1. **Energy flow decreases** with increasing redshift.  
2. **Entropy increases** steadily, confirming non-equilibrium thermodynamics.  
3. **Halos maintain dynamic stability** across clusters.  
4. **Spacetime distortion and lensing** are essential to interpreting observed energy trends.

These results validate the **Energy-Flow Cosmology** interpretation of cluster dynamics as an expression of entropic equilibrium and energy redistribution.

## 7. Recommendations
- Extend analysis to higher-redshift clusters.  
- Incorporate additional observational datasets (DESI, Euclid).  
- Simulate combined lensing–distortion effects for various morphologies.
