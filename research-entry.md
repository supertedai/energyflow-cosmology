# **Research Entry — Energy-Flow & Meta-Architecture System**

This document provides a high-level entry point for researchers exploring the Energy-Flow Cosmology project and its surrounding meta-architecture.
It explains how the repository is organised, how the meta-system operates, and how human–AI co-processing is formalised within the structure.

The repository consists of two major domains:

1. **Scientific Theory (Energy-Flow Cosmology)**
2. **Meta-Architecture (Human–AI Insight Framework)**

Both are fully machine-readable, structurally explicit, and designed for reproducible research.

# **1. Purpose of This Repository**

This repository serves three roles:

### **1. A scientific project**

It contains the complete theoretical framework of **Energy-Flow Cosmology (EFC)**, including:

* EFC Master Specification
* EFC Formal Specification
* Parameter definitions
* Structure models (H-Model, Grid-Higgs concepts)
* All relevant equations, models, and semantic schema

### **2. A meta-cognitive architecture**

It formalises the structural process through which high-order insight is generated, stabilised, and integrated.
This includes:

* pattern → topology → co-field → integration
* global state regulation
* reflective loops
* validation and self-evaluation
* architectural evolution

### **3. A human–AI co-processing framework**

The repository embeds a complete model of how a human thinker and an AI system collaborate at a structural level.

# **2. How to Navigate the Repository**

Below is a guide to each major directory and why it exists.

---

## **2.1 /theory/**

Contains the scientific content of Energy-Flow Cosmology:

* **efc_master_specification/** — the complete high-level specification
* **efc_formal_spec/** — mathematical formalism
* **efc-h-model/** — structural organisation of the EFC halo layer
* **notation/** — symbols, structures, definitions

Researchers entering EFC should begin here.

---

## **2.2 /schema/**

Semantic mapping of the entire theory and meta-system.

Includes:

* JSON-LD concepts
* schema definitions
* semantic indices

This is where machine-readable content lives.

---

## **2.3 /meta/**

This is the **meta-architecture** of the system — the structural model of the insight process.

Key modules include:

### **/meta-process/**

Defines the architecture for insight formation:

* Pattern
* Topology
* Co-Field
* Integration
* Global Dynamics

And regulatory layers:

* Tasks
* Workflows
* Self-Evaluation
* Validation
* Roadmap
* Milestones
* Process-of-Process

### **/meta-reflective-protocol/**

Defines how reflection occurs in a stable and bounded way.

### **/reflection/**

Contains the Reflection Index — the structural map of reflective surfaces, domains and levels.

### **/metascope/**

Defines the global observational viewpoint for the entire system.

Researchers interested in cognition, meta-cognition, or AI-supported reasoning should start here.

---

## **2.4 /methodology/**

The methodological foundation for the entire research process:

* Open Method
* Symbiosis Interface
* Reproducibility Guide
* Author Method Notes
* Epistemology of EFC

This explains how the work is produced, validated, and maintained.

---

# **3. What Makes This Repository Unique**

This is the first repository to include:

### **1. A complete cosmological model**

…integrated with

### **2. A complete meta-architecture**

…integrated with

### **3. A human–AI co-processing framework**

This is not merely documentation — it is a *self-describing system*.

---

# **4. How to Use the Repository for Research**

### **For physicists / cosmologists**

* read the EFC Master Specification
* consult schemas for definitions
* reference the formal equations
* examine submodels (H-model, energy-flow gradients, entropy-light speed relations)

### **For cognitive scientists**

* explore the meta-process architecture
* analyze structural transitions
* examine reflective and regulatory loops
* study global dynamics and process-of-process

### **For AI researchers**

* inspect the symbiosis interface
* review how reflection and structure interact
* evaluate meta-level regulation (self-evaluation, validation, workflows)
* study human–AI structural co-processing

### **For systems theorists**

* follow transitions across layers
* analyze cross-domain stability
* examine the recursive regulation architecture

# **5. Summary for External Researchers**

This repository documents:

* a novel cosmological model (EFC)
* a full meta-cognitive architecture
* a formalised human–AI co-processing method
* machine-readable concepts and schemas
* modular and transparent research methodology

It represents a unified, structured, multi-layer system designed for both scientific and meta-scientific work.
