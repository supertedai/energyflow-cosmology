Meta-Architecture — README

This directory contains the architectural model for the meta-layer of the Energy-Flow Cosmology (EFC) project. It describes how reflection, cognition, workflow and symbiosis are organised above the scientific theory.

Purpose:

* Define the structural logic of the meta-layer.
* Show how meta-level modules connect and interact.
* Maintain coherence across reflection, cognition, process and symbiosis.
* Provide a reference point for updates to any meta-level component.

Contents:

* index.md: human-readable explanation of the meta-architecture
* index.jsonld: machine-readable semantic structure

Role in the repository:
This directory links the main meta-level modules, including reflection, cognition, meta-process, meta-architecture, meta-architecture-spec, meta-reflective-protocol, personal and metascope. It provides the structure that keeps these modules aligned and clearly separated from the scientific theory in the theory directory.

Use:
Update this directory whenever reflective logic, cognitive frameworks, workflow structures or symbiosis mechanisms change. A stable meta-architecture ensures the full project stays traceable, readable and consistent across all documents and tools.
