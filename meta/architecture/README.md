# Meta-Architecture

This directory contains the architectural model for the meta-layer of the Energy-Flow Cosmology (EFC) project.  
It describes how reflection, cognition, workflow and symbiosis are organised above the scientific theory.

---

## Purpose

- Define the structural logic of the meta-layer.  
- Show how meta-level modules connect and interact.  
- Maintain coherence across reflection, cognition, process and symbiosis.  
- Provide a reference point for updates to any meta-level component.

---

## Contents

- `index.md` — human-readable explanation of the meta-architecture  
- `index.jsonld` — machine-readable semantic structure  

---

## Role in the repository

This directory links all major meta-level modules:

```

/meta/
architecture/              ← this directory
reflection/
cognition/
meta-process/
meta-architecture/
meta-architecture-spec/
meta-reflective-protocol/
personal/
metascope/

```

The meta-architecture ensures that these modules follow a consistent structural model and remain clearly separated from the scientific theory stored in `/theory/`.

---

## Use

Update this directory when adding or modifying reflective logic, cognitive frameworks, workflow structures or symbiosis mechanisms.  
Keeping this architecture stable ensures that the full project remains traceable, readable and aligned across all documents and tools.
