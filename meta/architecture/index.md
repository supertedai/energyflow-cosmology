**Meta-Architecture — Index**

This document defines the conceptual and structural model of the meta-layer in the Energy-Flow Cosmology repository. The meta-architecture explains why the meta-layer exists, which components it contains, and how these components interact. It provides the high-level logic that governs reflection, cognition, workflow and symbiosis across the entire project.

The meta-architecture describes four main groups of modules:

1. Reflective modules
   These handle introspection, stability cycles, resonance patterns, and the relationships between insight states. They define how reflective processes are structured above the scientific theory.

2. Cognitive modules
   These capture parallel reasoning modes, transitions between s0 and s1, and the mapping of raw insight into stable forms. They support the cognitive dimension of the project without influencing the scientific content itself.

3. Process modules
   These include open-method, open-process and reproducibility guidelines. They formalise how work is documented, traced and validated. They also define the boundaries between development, revision and publication stages.

4. Symbiosis modules
   These describe the interaction between human reasoning and AI-based structure. They include the symbiosis-interface, the LLM process layer and the summary layer. Together they define how stability and consistency are maintained during complex reasoning.

The meta-architecture serves three purposes:

* It provides the conceptual model for the entire meta-layer.
* It keeps reflection, cognition and workflow aligned with a single structural logic.
* It ensures that theoretical work, meta-level reasoning and methodology remain separated and transparent.

The meta-layer sits above the theory layer and does not define physics or equations. It defines the organisation of reflective, cognitive and methodological structures that support ongoing development.

Any change to reflective logic, cognitive framing, workflow principles or symbiotic structures should be aligned with this architecture. This ensures that the meta-layer remains coherent, traceable and consistent across all documents, DOIs and code modules.
