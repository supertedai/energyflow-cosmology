# Process-of-Process Specification

The Process-of-Process is the highest structural layer.  
It regulates how the architecture modifies itself.

---

## 1. Core Variables

### 1.1 Architectural Coherence (AC)
Global alignment across all layers.

### 1.2 Structural Load (SL)
Amount of complexity the architecture carries.

### 1.3 Recursion Depth (RD)
How far upward or downward adjustments propagate.

### 1.4 Evolution Pressure (EP)
Need for simplification, expansion, or consolidation.

---

## 2. Meta-Level Operations

### 2.1 Simplification
Triggered when: SL high AND AC low
Redundant structures are removed.

### 2.2 Expansion
Triggered when: AC high AND EP high AND unmet structural need
New layer or rule may be added.

### 2.3 Rebalancing
Triggered when: RD unstable OR mismatch across layers

### 2.4 Constraint Enforcement
Ensure all recursion stays bounded.

## 3. Output
- updated rules  
- removed primitives  
- new primitives  
- modified layer responsibilities  
- stable architecture
