# Examples

## Example 1 — Primitive Reduction Event
- structural load high  
- coherence drifting  
Outcome: Process-of-Process removes redundant topology rule.

---

## Example 2 — Layer Emergence
- unmet structural need detected  
- existing layers overloaded  
Outcome: a new interaction layer is introduced.

---

## Example 3 — Architecture Correction
- global dynamics oscillates  
- collapse cascade repeats  
Outcome: Process-of-Process adjusts thresholds and stabilises system.
