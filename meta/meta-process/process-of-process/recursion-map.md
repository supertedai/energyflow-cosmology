# Recursion Map

Defines how recursion operates and where it stops.

---

## 1. Allowed Recursion
- rule updates  
- threshold adjustments  
- primitive consolidation  
- global state correction  

---

## 2. Disallowed Recursion
- infinite regress  
- recursion into cognition  
- recursion that modifies lower layers directly  
- recursion that changes semantics instead of structure  

---

## 3. Recursion Boundaries
- Process-of-Process may modify Global Dynamics  
- Global Dynamics may not modify Process-of-Process  
- Integration Layer may not trigger recursion  

---

## 4. Recursion Depth Limits
Maximum depth: Process-of-Process → Global Dynamics → Integration → Co-Field → Topology → Pattern

No loops below Pattern.
