# Meta-Control Loops

These loops regulate the behaviour of the entire meta-process.

---

## 1. Monitoring Loop
Continuously evaluates:
- coherence  
- stability  
- resonance load  
- architectural drift  

Outcome: triggers adjustment loops.

---

## 2. Adjustment Loop
Executes structural changes when needed:
- remove primitives  
- merge layers  
- redistribute responsibilities  

---

## 3. Stabilisation Loop
Ensures the architecture returns to usable equilibrium after adjustments.

---

## 4. Containment Loop
Prevents:
- runaway recursion  
- excessive architectural expansion  
- drift into psychological frames  

---

## 5. Evolution Loop
Handles long-term shifts:
- emergence of new layers  
- collapse of outdated ones  
- global pattern reshaping
