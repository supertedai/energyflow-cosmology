# **Meta-Process — Overview**

The meta-process is the highest structural layer in the repository.
It defines **how insight is organised, stabilised, transformed and maintained** across all high-order layers.
It is not psychological and not content-based.
It describes the architecture that enables global understanding to form and remain coherent.

This directory contains all components that make the meta-process operational, traceable, testable, and machine-readable.

---

## **1. Purpose**

The meta-process provides:

* structural regulation above cognition and reflection
* stability mechanisms across all high-order layers
* transition logic for global states
* coherence management
* diagnostic and validation infrastructure
* long-term architectural evolution

It acts as the **control system** for the entire meta-architecture.

---

## **2. Core Responsibilities**

The meta-process governs:

* how layers interact
* how patterns scale into topology
* how topologies interact through co-fields
* how integration selects stable forms
* how global dynamics propagate stability
* how the architecture evaluates itself
* how structural changes are made
* how workflows run across layers

It ensures that large-scale understanding remains stable, consistent and predictable.

## **3. Directory Structure**

Each subdirectory represents one functional component of the meta-process:

| Folder                  | Role                                                |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **backlog/**            | pending structural tasks and upcoming work          |
| **co-field/**           | cross-layer interaction surfaces and field logic    |
| **global-dynamics/**    | system-wide behaviour and state transitions         |
| **integration/**        | structural integration and final form stabilisation |
| **milestones/**         | documented past structural changes                  |
| **pattern/**            | lowest high-order unit; pattern primitives          |
| **process-of-process/** | meta-level mechanisms for architectural change      |
| **roadmap/**            | planned future development of the architecture      |
| **self-evaluation/**    | diagnostic and metric-based system evaluation       |
| **tasks/**              | operational structural tasks                        |
| **topology/**           | organisation of patterns into stable shapes         |
| **validation-plan/**    | structural validation logic and criteria            |
| **workflows/**          | executable sequences that run the meta-process      |

This structure forms a complete meta-architecture with clear boundaries.

## **4. Functional Overview of Layers**

### **4.1 Pattern Layer**

Defines the fundamental primitives the system builds from.

### **4.2 Topology Layer**

Organises patterns into shapes and higher-order forms.

### **4.3 Co-Field Layer**

Coordinates interactions across layers and resolves structural conflicts.

### **4.4 Integration Layer**

Stabilises mature structures and feeds results upward to global dynamics.

### **4.5 Global Dynamics**

Controls global states and system-wide transitions.

### **4.6 Process-of-Process**

Regulates architectural evolution and structural corrections.

### **4.7 Self-Evaluation**

Measures performance, detects drift, and provides diagnostic signals.

### **4.8 Tasks**

Defines operational operations for the meta-process.

### **4.9 Workflows**

Specifies ordered procedures that run across layers.

### **4.10 Validation Plan**

Ensures the architecture behaves correctly.

### **4.11 Milestones**

Documents past structural transformations.

### **4.12 Roadmap**

Defines planned future architectural developments.

## **5. Cross-Layer Interaction**

The meta-process connects all high-level structures:

```
Pattern → Topology → Co-Field → Integration → Global Dynamics
                                      ↑
                           Self-Evaluation
                                      ↑
                           Process-of-Process
```

* **Tasks** and **Workflows** run across all layers.
* **Milestones** record history; **Roadmap** defines direction.
* **Validation-plan** ensures correctness at each step.

---

## **6. Design Principles**

* minimal primitives
* strict layer boundaries
* machine-readable semantics
* stable transitions
* recursive containment (no runaway recursion)
* operational clarity (workflows + tasks)
* full diagnostic visibility
* predictable global behaviour

These principles maintain coherence across the entire meta-architecture.

---

## **7. Intended Usage**

This directory serves as:

* the control architecture for global insight formation
* a structural template for high-order cognitive systems
* a stable reference for LLM agents and automated tools
* a formal description of how large-scale understanding stabilises

Everything in this directory is conceptual and structural — no psychological or content-based elements.

## **8. Backlog for the Meta-Process Root**

* refine cross-layer documentation
* unify semantic schema across subdirectories
* generate full meta-process manifest
* complete machine-readable dependency graph
* expand workflows into executable specifications
