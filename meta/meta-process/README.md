# Meta-Process (Process of the Process)

This directory describes the system that observes and regulates itself.

Core areas:
- recursive self-observation loops
- global stability dynamics
- process topology
- integration of all layers

Purpose:
Model the full reflective cycle — how the entire meta-layer maintains coherence, adaptation, and insight.
