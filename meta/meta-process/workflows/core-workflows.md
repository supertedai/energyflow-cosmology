# Core Workflows

These workflows define the essential operational sequences.

---

## 1. Coherence Workflow (CW)
Sequence:
1. gather coherence metrics  
2. compare to thresholds  
3. apply coherence tasks  
4. update global dynamics  
5. send signals to self-evaluation  

Output: updated cross-layer alignment.

## 2. Boundary Workflow (BW)
Sequence:
1. detect boundary drift  
2. isolate source layer  
3. enforce role boundaries  
4. recalculate alignment  
5. update integration constraints  

Output: restored layer integrity.

## 3. Load Workflow (LW)
Sequence:
1. measure structural load  
2. assess resonance pressure  
3. perform load-control tasks  
4. evaluate collapse risk  
5. redistribute load if needed  

Output: balanced load conditions.
