# Transition Workflows

These workflows handle structural transitions.

---

## 1. Layer Transition Workflow (LTW)
Sequence:
1. trigger from global dynamics  
2. validate transition criteria  
3. collect task outputs  
4. confirm threshold satisfaction  
5. execute transition  
6. propagate results  

Output: verified layer transition.

## 2. State Transition Workflow (STW)
Handles:
- expansion → consolidation  
- consolidation → resonance  
- resonance → fragmentation  
- fragmentation → recovery  

Sequence:
1. detect state threshold  
2. evaluate global load  
3. run transition tasks  
4. confirm stability  
5. shift global state  

Output: stable global state shift.
