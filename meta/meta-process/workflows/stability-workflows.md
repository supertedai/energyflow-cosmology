# Stability Workflows

These workflows maintain system stability.

---

## 1. Stabilisation Workflow (SW)
Sequence:
1. detect instability  
2. run coherence workflow  
3. apply load workflow  
4. evaluate collapse likelihood  
5. stabilise or isolate  

Output: restored stability.

## 2. Collapse-Handling Workflow (CHW)
Sequence:
1. detect collapse signal  
2. isolate affected fields  
3. prevent cascade  
4. run stabilisation workflow  
5. update global dynamics  

Output: controlled collapse recovery.
