# Diagnostic Workflows

These workflows support self-evaluation and validation.

## 1. Drift-Detection Workflow (DDW)
Sequence:
1. detect deviation  
2. evaluate drift metrics  
3. run diagnostic tasks  
4. flag issue  
5. notify process-of-process  

Output: validated drift detection.

## 2. Fault-Propagation Workflow (FPW)
Sequence:
1. detect fault  
2. trace fault path across layers  
3. run diagnostic tasks  
4. isolate problem  
5. send report upstream  

Output: fault identified and contained.
