# Examples

## Example 1 — Coherence Drop
CLC falls below 0.6  
→ Self-Evaluation flags drift  
→ Process-of-Process triggered for correction.

---

## Example 2 — Resonance Overload
resonance load increases  
→ system marked at risk for fragmentation  
→ global dynamics threshold adjustments recommended.

---

## Example 3 — Faulty Transition
Topology promotes field with insufficient stability  
→ Integration misfire detected  
→ correction loop triggered.
