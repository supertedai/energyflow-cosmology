# Consistency Tests

Defines tests to ensure the meta-architecture operates correctly.

---

## 1. Boundary Tests
Verify:
- each layer stays within scope  
- no layer performs neighbour's function  

---

## 2. Transition Tests
Confirm:
- transitions occur only under valid conditions  
- no missing or skipped transitions  

---

## 3. Stability Tests
Ensure:
- stable states persist long enough  
- collapse events are isolated  
- integration outputs remain valid  

---

## 4. Load Tests
Check:
- structural load within limits  
- resonance load not accumulating dangerously  

---

## 5. Recursion Tests
Validate:
- recursion depth does not exceed allowed capacity  
- no uncontrolled loops
