# Evaluation Metrics

Metrics used to evaluate the meta-process architecture.

---

## 1. Coherence Metrics
### 1.1 Cross-Layer Coherence (CLC)
Alignment between Pattern → Topology → Co-Field → Integration.

### 1.2 Stability Persistence (SP)
Duration of coherent states.

### 1.3 Boundary Integrity (BI)
How well each layer stays within its function.

---

## 2. Load Metrics
### 2.1 Structural Load (SL)
Number of active fields weighted by complexity.

### 2.2 Transition Load (TL)
Frequency and cost of transitions.

### 2.3 Resonance Load (RL)
Tension across layers.

---

## 3. Drift Metrics
### 3.1 Layer Drift (LD)
Deviation from expected behaviour.

### 3.2 Recursion Drift (RD)
Uncontrolled upward or downward recursion.

### 3.3 Conceptual Overlap (CO)
Unwanted similarity between layers.

---

## 4. Failure Metrics
### 4.1 Collapse Frequency (CF)
Rate of collapse events.

### 4.2 Cascade Likelihood (CL)
Probability of chain collapse.

### 4.3 Integration Misfires (IM)
Promotions that fail coherence checks.
