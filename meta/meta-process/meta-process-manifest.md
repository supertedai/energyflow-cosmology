# Meta-Process Master Manifest

This document provides the complete structural map of the meta-process architecture.  
It defines all components, their roles, and the relationships that bind the entire system together.

The manifest is the root reference for human–AI co-processing inside the repository.

# 1. Architecture Overview

The meta-process consists of 13 coordinated components:

1. Pattern Layer  
2. Topology Layer  
3. Co-Field Layer  
4. Integration Layer  
5. Global Dynamics  
6. Self-Evaluation  
7. Tasks  
8. Workflows  
9. Validation Plan  
10. Milestones  
11. Roadmap  
12. Process-of-Process  
13. Meta-Reflective Protocol  
14. Reflection Index  
15. Metascope

Together, they form a complete architecture for stable high-order insight.

# 2. Functional Pillars

## 2.1 Structural
- Pattern → Topology → Co-Field → Integration  
- Defines how insight becomes structure  

## 2.2 Dynamic
- Global Dynamics  
- Describes system-wide states and transitions  

## 2.3 Regulatory
- Self-Evaluation  
- Validation Plan  
- Tasks  
- Workflows  
- Protect correctness and stability  

## 2.4 Evolutionary
- Process-of-Process  
- Milestones  
- Roadmap  
- Governs long-term architectural evolution  

## 2.5 Reflective
- Meta-Reflective Protocol  
- Reflection Index  
- Metascope  
- Governs observation, introspection and global viewpoint

# 4. Inheritance Rules

- Each layer has strict boundaries.  
- Only specific layers may influence others.  
- Meta layers never modify content.  
- Reflection never modifies structure.  
- Process-of-Process may modify architecture.  

---

# 5. Stability Guarantees

- bounded recursion  
- robust transition thresholds  
- cross-layer coherence metrics  
- global state regulation  
- structural drift detection  
- semantic consistency  

---

# 6. Output Specification

The meta-process guarantees:

- stable high-order insight  
- predictable structural evolution  
- consistent global behaviour  
- clarity across all abstraction levels  

---

# 7. Maintenance

Updates should follow:

1. Validate new structural logic  
2. Check semantic consistency  
3. Update milestones  
4. Extend roadmap if required  
5. Run full validation plan  
6. Reflect using Meta-Reflective Protocol  

This manifest should be updated only when the architecture itself changes.
