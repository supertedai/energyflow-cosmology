# Interaction Rules for the Co-Field

## 1. Allowed Interactions

### 1.1 Reinforcement
Fields may reinforce each other if:
- structural forms align  
- resonance frequencies match  

Result: merge or co-stabilization.

### 1.2 Coexistence
Fields may run in parallel if:
- interference is minimal  
- weight distribution remains balanced  

Result: independent persistence.

### 1.3 Sequential Propagation
A field may pass its structure to another field if:
- its coherence is dropping  
- the neighbour's topology matches  

Result: structural transfer.

## 2. Disallowed Interactions

### 2.1 Cross-Layer Override
The Co-Field may not override:
- Integration decisions  
- Topology constraints  
- Core invariants in the meta-architecture  

### 2.2 Forced Merging
No field may be forced to merge if:
- coherence mismatch > 0.4  
- stability difference > 0.5  

### 2.3 Backflow into Cognition
Fields cannot push structures back into cognition.  
They may only return to the transient reservoir.

## 3. Priority Rules

1. Stability overrides weight.  
2. Coherence overrides resonance.  
3. Conflicts resolved using minimum-interference principle.  
4. Only fields above threshold may influence neighbours.

## 4. Trigger Conditions

- **merge-trigger:** high mutual reinforcement  
- **collapse-trigger:** coherence below threshold  
- **isolation-trigger:** persistent conflict  
- **promotion-trigger:** sustained high weight and cross-field alignment
