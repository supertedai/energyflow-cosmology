# Co-Field Examples

## Example 1 — Merge
Two candidate structures share similar topology and reinforce each other.

- Field A: C = 0.72, W = 0.55  
- Field B: C = 0.68, W = 0.50  
- Interaction I = high  

Outcome: merged field sent to Topology Layer.

---

## Example 2 — Collapse After Conflict
Two incompatible structures overlap but cannot stabilize.

- Field A: C = 0.35  
- Field B: C = 0.40  
- Interaction I = conflicting  
- No reinforcing neighbours  

Outcome: A collapses; B isolates.

---

## Example 3 — Promotion
A highly stable structure influences multiple neighbours.

- Field X: C = 0.85, W = 0.78  
- Reinforces 3 surrounding fields  
- No conflicts detected  

Outcome: X is promoted to Integration Layer.
