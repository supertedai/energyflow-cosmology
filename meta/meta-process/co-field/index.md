# **Co-Field Layer**

*Location: `meta/meta-process/co-field/`*

The Co-Field is the layer where multiple structural fields interact.
It sits above cognition and below global integration.
Its role is to coordinate parallel structures, resolve conflicts, and stabilize shared form.

This directory contains the definitions, mechanisms, and constraints for how fields co-evolve during insight formation.

---

# **1. Purpose of the Co-Field**

The Co-Field governs interaction between simultaneously active structures:

* pattern fields
* topological fields
* integration fields
* resonance surfaces
* transient cognitive structures

Its function is to ensure that multiple partial structures can exist in parallel without destabilizing the global meta-architecture.

---

# **2. Core Functions**

The Co-Field performs four primary roles:

### **2.1 Synchronization**

Keeps parallel structures aligned when they evolve at different speeds.

### **2.2 Conflict Resolution**

Determines which structural candidate stabilizes when multiple options compete.

### **2.3 Cross-Field Reinforcement**

Detects when two or more partial structures amplify each other and should merge.

### **2.4 Field Isolation**

Prevents incompatible structures from interfering by placing them in separate local basins.

---

# **3. Structural Components**

### **3.1 Coherence Map**

A dynamic map showing where fields overlap, reinforce, or interfere.

### **3.2 Transition Gates**

Rules that decide when a structure can move:

* from pattern → topology
* from topology → integration
* or back to transient state after collapse

### **3.3 Stability Thresholds**

Entropy-style constraints defining when a field is strong enough to influence others.

### **3.4 Field Weights**

Relative influence factors:

* structural weight
* temporal weight
* resonance weight
* integration weight

---

# **4. Process Logic**

### **4.1 Multi-Field Input**

The Co-Field takes simultaneous input from:

* cognition
* symbiosis interface
* meta-architecture
* transient representation layer
* pattern generator

### **4.2 Co-Evaluation**

Each structure is evaluated for:

* coherence
* consistency
* scalability
* compatibility with existing fields
* potential to stabilize

### **4.3 Decision Nodes**

Three possible outcomes:

1. **Merge** fields into a shared structure
2. **Allow parallel coexistence**
3. **Isolate or collapse** the field

### **4.4 Output**

Once resolved, the Co-Field sends:

* stable candidates → Integration Layer
* unresolved candidates → Topology Layer
* collapsed candidates → transient reservoir

# **5. Backlog**

Tasks needed to complete this directory.

### **5.1 Formal Specification**

* Define the mathematical / structural form of a Co-Field.
* Specify the minimal variables: coherence, weight, stability, interaction strength.
* Create a general representation format usable across the repo.

### **5.2 JSON-LD Semantics**

* Add machine-readable definitions for:

  * co-field
  * resonance link
  * interaction surface
  * field weight
  * collapse trigger
* Link vocabulary to global DefinedTermSet.

### **5.3 Interaction Rules**

* Document allowed and disallowed transitions.
* Specify how conflict resolution is computed.
* Clarify how multiple fields merge or diverge.

### **5.4 Stability Conditions**

* Describe stability thresholds in simple, measurable terms.
* Define the criteria for:

  * reinforcement
  * suppression
  * collapse
  * isolation

### **5.5 Cross-Layer Mapping**

* Link Co-Field operations to:

  * Meta-Architecture
  * Pattern Layer
  * Topology Layer
  * Integration Layer
* Provide a unified diagram of flows.

### **5.6 Examples**

* At least three minimal examples:

  1. Two partial structures merge into one field.
  2. A structure collapses after conflict.
  3. A stable field promotes another field into integration.

# **6. Open Questions**

Items requiring conceptual expansion.

* How many co-fields can exist simultaneously?
* Should fields be treated as continuous surfaces or discrete nodes?
* Can a Co-Field override an Integration decision if resonance shifts?
* Should conflict resolution be deterministic or threshold-based?
* How does entropy or energy metaphor apply in this layer?
