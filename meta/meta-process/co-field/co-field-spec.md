# Co-Field Specification

## 1. Definition
A **Co-Field** is a high-level interaction layer where multiple structural fields operate simultaneously.  
Its function is to coordinate, filter, merge, or isolate competing or reinforcing structures.

It acts as the intermediate layer between:
- the Pattern and Topology layers (upstream)
- the Integration Layer (downstream)

## 2. Core Variables

### 2.1 Coherence (C)
Measure of internal consistency of a field.  
Range: 0.0–1.0

### 2.2 Field Weight (W)
Relative influence of a field during interaction.  
Composite of:
- structural weight  
- temporal weight  
- resonance weight  
- integration weight  

### 2.3 Stability Threshold (T)
Minimum required coherence for the field to remain active.

### 2.4 Interaction Strength (I)
Strength of coupling between two fields.  
Derived from:
- overlap of structural features  
- similarity of topology  
- frequency matching in transient dynamics  

## 3. Co-Field Operations

### 3.1 Merge
Two or more fields combine when: C₁ > T AND C₂ > T AND I₁₂ high

### 3.2 Parallel Coexistence
Fields coexist independently when: I low AND both C above minimum

### 3.3 Isolation
Field is isolated when: C below threshold BUT internal resonance preserved

### 3.4 Collapse
Field collapses when: C < T AND no reinforcing neighbours

### 3.5 Promotion
A field is sent to the Integration Layer when: C high, W high, and I reinforces multiple neighbours

## 4. Output States

- **merged field**  
- **isolated field**  
- **promoted field**  
- **collapsed field**  

The Integration Layer only receives promoted fields.
