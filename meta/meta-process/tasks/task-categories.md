# Task Categories

The meta-process performs tasks across six structural categories.

---

## 1. Coherence Tasks
Maintain structural alignment:
- check cross-layer coherence  
- enforce consistency  
- stabilise drift  

---

## 2. Transition Tasks
Ensure transitions are valid:
- validate incoming transitions  
- prepare outgoing transitions  
- detect transition failures  

---

## 3. Diagnostic Tasks
Support Self-Evaluation:
- collect metrics  
- detect anomalies  
- flag instability  

---

## 4. Load-Control Tasks
Manage structural load:
- measure active field distribution  
- balance resonance load  
- prevent overload  

---

## 5. Boundary Tasks
Protect layer integrity:
- enforce functional boundaries  
- prevent role leakage  
- ensure scope clarity  

---

## 6. Consolidation Tasks
Help unify structures:
- detect overlapping primitives  
- prepare merging operations  
- identify consolidation opportunities
