# Task Flow

This document describes how tasks propagate through the architecture.

---

## 1. Upstream Sources
Tasks are triggered by:

- Global Dynamics  
- Self-Evaluation  
- Process-of-Process  
- layer drift  
- transition pressure  

---

## 2. Processing Flow

### Step 1 — Trigger
A signal from evaluation or dynamics initiates a task.

### Step 2 — Classification
Task assigned to:
- coherence  
- transition  
- diagnostic  
- load-control  
- boundary  
- consolidation  

### Step 3 — Execution
Tasks operate on:
- metrics  
- thresholds  
- cross-layer relationships  
- stability surfaces  

### Step 4 — Output
Generated outcomes:
- warnings  
- validated transitions  
- boundary corrections  
- consolidation candidates  
- load redistribution signals

## 3. Downstream Consumers
Outputs are used by:

- Global Dynamics  
- Integration Layer  
- Process-of-Process  
- Self-Evaluation
