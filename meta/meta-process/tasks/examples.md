# Examples

## Example 1 — Coherence Task
Trigger: cross-layer alignment falls  
Task: Coherence Maintenance  
Output: stability warning sent to Self-Evaluation.

---

## Example 2 — Transition Task
Trigger: global dynamics entering consolidation  
Task: validate topology → co-field transitions  
Output: confirmed transition readiness.

---

## Example 3 — Load-Control Task
Trigger: resonance load spike  
Task: redistributing load across layers  
Output: updated load metrics to Global Dynamics.

---

## Example 4 — Boundary Task
Trigger: topology begins performing co-field operations  
Task: enforce layer boundaries  
Output: correction issued.
