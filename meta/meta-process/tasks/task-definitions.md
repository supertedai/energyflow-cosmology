# Task Definitions

Detailed descriptions of core structural tasks.

---

## 1. Coherence Maintenance
Task:
- evaluate alignment of Pattern → Topology → Co-Field → Integration  

Trigger:
- coherence metric drops  
- global dynamics enters unstable zone  

---

## 2. Boundary Enforcement
Task:
- ensure each layer stays within its intended function  

Trigger:
- drift detection signals  
- overlap in responsibilities  

---

## 3. Transition Validation
Task:
- verify that transition conditions are met  
- confirm that outgoing transitions are structurally valid  

Trigger:
- global dynamics signals a transition  

---

## 4. Load Balancing
Task:
- redistribute structural load  
- adjust resonance pressure  

Trigger:
- increasing resonance load  
- collapse risk observed  

---

## 5. Consolidation Preparation
Task:
- detect redundant structures  
- identify merging candidates  

Trigger:
- repeated conceptual overlap  
- structural load too high  

---

## 6. Diagnostic Collection
Task:
- gather metrics  
- flag anomalies  
- generate signals for Self-Evaluation  

Trigger:
- periodic  
- overload  
- instability
