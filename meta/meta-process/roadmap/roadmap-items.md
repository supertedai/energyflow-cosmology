---

## 3. Global Dynamics v2

- introduce resonance load metric  
- define collapse cascade boundaries  
- add cross-layer tension indicators  

---

## 4. Semantic Extensions

- unify identifiers across layers  

---

## 5. Process-of-Process Upgrades
- add adaptive recursion depth control  
- improve simplification heuristics  
- integrate milestone feedback loops  

---

## 6. Next-Generation Architecture
