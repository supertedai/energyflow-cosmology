# Meta-Process Roadmap

The roadmap outlines the planned future development of the meta-process architecture.  
It describes upcoming structural changes, planned reductions, expected layer upgrades, and long-range evolution of the system.

This document is forward-looking and complements:
- **milestones** (past structural events)  
- **process-of-process** (mechanisms of architectural change)

---

## 1. Purpose
- Define upcoming structural expansions  
- Plan reductions of redundant primitives  
- Outline improvements to inter-layer coherence  
- Forecast expected transitions in global dynamics  
- Provide a clear direction for long-term architectural evolution  

---

## 2. Scope
The roadmap covers work that has *not yet happened*, but is expected or planned.  
It focuses on structural development, not model content.

---

## 3. Roadmap Themes

### 3.1 Layer Refinement
- Clarify boundaries between Topology, Co-Field, and Integration  
- Reduce ambiguity in Pattern transitions  
- Improve stability surfaces across layers  

### 3.2 Primitive Reduction
- Identify redundant primitives across layers  
- Collapse overlapping structural concepts  
- Move towards minimal, high-coherence architecture  

### 3.3 Global Dynamics Upgrade
- Introduce refined state-transition thresholds  
- Add resonance load metrics  
- Improve collapse cascade handling  

### 3.4 Process-of-Process Enhancements
- Add meta-level feedback rules  
- Improve recursion boundaries  
- Stabilise long-range structural cycles  

### 3.5 Semantic Expansion
- Extend JSON-LD vocabulary  
- Standardise naming conventions  
- Improve cross-layer machine readability  

---

## 4. Planned Deliverables

- updated Topology → Co-Field transition rules  
- refined Integration promotion thresholds  
- global dynamics resonance map v2  
- unified structural manifest  
- semantic ontology for meta-process signalling  
- minimal primitive set for next architecture revision  

---

## 5. Long-Term Directions

### 5.1 Architectural Unification
Goal:
A meta-process with the smallest number of necessary layers.

### 5.2 Predictive Meta-Behaviour
Define metrics to anticipate:
- stability drift  
- resonance imbalance  
- upcoming transitions  

### 5.3 Self-Optimising Architecture
Introduce structural self-correction based on:
- coherence tracking  
- load minimisation  
- feedback saturation  

### 5.4 Extended Semantic Layer
Move towards:
- full machine-integration  
- cross-repository semantic linking  
- automated extraction-support
