# Roadmap Timeline

This timeline outlines expected future phases of architectural evolution.

---

## Phase A — Short-Term (Next Iteration)
- refine topology boundaries  
- update co-field thresholds  
- add global dynamics load metrics  
- semantic expansion  

---

## Phase B — Mid-Term (Next Major Revision)
- primitive reduction  
- layer consolidation where possible  
- transition logic v2  
- structure manifest generation  

---

## Phase C — Long-Term (Next Architecture)
- minimal primitive set  
- fully stable meta-process  
- predictive state transitions  
- unified semantic ontology  

---

## Phase D — Extended Horizon
- automated pattern extraction  
- meta-level self-correction  
- adaptive architecture evolution  
- cross-repository semantic networks
