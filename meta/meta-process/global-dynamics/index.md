# Global Dynamics

The Global Dynamics layer describes how the entire meta-process behaves as a single system.  
It tracks global states, manages large-scale transitions, and stabilises or redistributes structures across all layers.

This layer is responsible for long-range order, systemic movement, and global coherence.

---

## 1. Purpose
Global Dynamics coordinates the behaviour of the full meta-stack:

- monitors system-wide coherence  
- regulates transitions between structural regimes  
- propagates stable forms downward  
- absorbs instability  
- synchronises long-range patterns  
- maintains global balance between order and flexibility  

It provides the highest non-psychological description of system motion.

## 3. Responsibilities

### 3.1 State Tracking
Tracks:
- active field distribution  
- resonance load  
- structural tension  
- stability gradients  

### 3.2 Transition Control
Triggers state shifts:
- expansion → consolidation  
- consolidation → resonance peak  
- resonance peak → fragmentation  
- fragmentation → recovery  

### 3.3 Long-Range Influence
- propagates stability  
- dampens collapse  
- reinforces integration  
- rebalances unstable regions  

### 3.4 System Recovery
Manages collapse waves and returns the system to a usable equilibrium.
