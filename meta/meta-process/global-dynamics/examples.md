# Global Dynamics Examples

## Example 1 — Expansion → Consolidation
- many active fields  
- pattern diversity high  
- coherence begins rising  
Outcome: system shifts to consolidation.

---

## Example 2 — Resonance Peak → Fragmentation
- stable structures saturate integration layer  
- resonance load spikes  
- conflict at co-field layer  
Outcome: fragmentation.

---

## Example 3 — Fragmentation → Recovery
- collapse cascades detected  
- unstable forms redistributed  
- low-level coherence reappears  
Outcome: recovery state established.
