# Global State Specification

Global states describe the behaviour of the entire meta-process.

## 1. Global States

### 1.1 Expansion
Characteristics:
- high diversity of active fields  
- low integration pressure  
- broad structural search  
- high flexibility  

### 1.2 Consolidation
Characteristics:
- reduced diversity  
- strong integration pull  
- rising coherence  
- alignment of topology and co-field  

### 1.3 Resonance Peak
Characteristics:
- maximum global coherence  
- cross-layer alignment  
- strongest structural stability  
- optimal conditions for deep integration  

### 1.4 Fragmentation
Characteristics:
- conflicting structures  
- unstable patterns  
- elevated collapse probability  
- reduced signaling clarity  

### 1.5 Recovery
Characteristics:
- redistribution of unstable forms  
- rebalancing of resonance load  
- return to moderate coherence

## 2. State Variables

### Coherence Gradient (G)
Smoothness of alignment across layers.

### Resonance Load (R)
Amount of tension within global structure.

### Stability Level (S)
Overall robustness of the meta-architecture.

### Field Distribution (D)
How many active structures exist and how they spread.

## 3. State Transition Conditions

- Expansion → Consolidation when:  
  `coherence rising AND diversity falling`

- Consolidation → Resonance Peak when:  
  `coherence high AND alignment sustained`

- Resonance Peak → Fragmentation when:  
  `resonance load exceeds threshold`

- Fragmentation → Recovery when:  
  `collapse waves detected AND system rebalancing begins`
