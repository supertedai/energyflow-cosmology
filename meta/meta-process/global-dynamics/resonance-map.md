# Resonance Map

This document describes how resonance propagates across the meta-process.

---

## 1. Resonance Sources
- integration outputs  
- stable topologies  
- co-field reinforcements  
- transient high-coherence signals  

---

## 2. Resonance Propagation
Resonance flows: Integration → Co-Field → Topology → Pattern

Reverse flows occur only during:
- collapse  
- fragmentation  
- overload  

---

## 3. Resonance Load
Indicators:
- cross-layer tension  
- competing stable fields  
- saturation in integration layer  

High resonance load increases transition likelihood to fragmentation.

---

## 4. Stabilization Waves
When resonance is high but aligned:
- stability waves propagate downward  
- coherent structures reinforce patterns  
- integration becomes more efficient  

---

## 5. Resonance Breakdown
Occurs when:
- too many competing forms  
- insufficient structural capacity  
- mismatch across layers  

Leads to fragmentation.
