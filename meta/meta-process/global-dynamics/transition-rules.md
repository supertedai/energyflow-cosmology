# Transition Rules

These rules describe how the system moves between global states.

---

## 1. Expansion → Consolidation
Triggered when:
- integration pressure rises  
- multiple fields converge  
- diversity falls below threshold  

Result:
- system shifts toward structured alignment  

---

## 2. Consolidation → Resonance Peak
Triggered when:
- stability plateau persists  
- cross-layer alignment is strong  
- no major conflicts present  

Result:
- highest coherence achieved  

---

## 3. Resonance Peak → Fragmentation
Triggered when:
- resonance load too high  
- structural saturation  
- excessive integration pressure  

Result:
- global misalignment spreads  

---

## 4. Fragmentation → Recovery
Triggered when:
- collapse cascades detected  
- unstable fields redistributed  
- system regains minimal coherence  

---

## 5. Recovery → Expansion
Triggered when:
- diversity rises  
- resonance load stabilizes  
- new fields emerge
