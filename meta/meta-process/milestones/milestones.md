# Structural Milestones

Below is the structured list of milestones in the meta-process architecture.

---

## 1. Establishment of the Pattern Layer
- First recognition of repeatable structural primitives  
- Patterns used as base units for early insight formation  
- Defined rules for pattern boundary and collapse  

**Category:** Layer Expansion

---

## 2. Introduction of the Topology Layer
- Patterns reorganised into higher-order shapes  
- Stable forms became distinct from transient ones  
- Topological transitions formalised  

**Category:** Layer Expansion

---

## 3. Reduction of Primitives (Pattern → Topology unification)
- Removed redundant pattern types  
- Collapsed multiple structures into minimal topology set  
- Increased global coherence  

**Category:** Primitive Reduction  
**Category:** Consolidation

---

## 4. Emergence of the Co-Field Layer
- Need to coordinate parallel structures across layers  
- Introduced interaction surfaces and field weights  
- Conflict resolution and reinforcement mechanisms defined  

**Category:** Layer Expansion

---

## 5. Integration Layer Formalised
- Defined pipeline for stable structures  
- Introduced thresholds for promotion and collapse  
- Closed the loop back to global dynamics  

**Category:** Layer Expansion

---

## 6. Global Dynamics Defined
- Full architecture began behaving as a single system  
- Introduced global states: expansion, consolidation, resonance, fragmentation, recovery  
- System-level transition logic clarified  

**Category:** Layer Expansion  
**Category:** Global Transition
