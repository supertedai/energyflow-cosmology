# Meta-Process Milestones

The milestones track the structural evolution of the meta-process architecture.  
They document key transitions, consolidations, and shifts in how the system organises high-order insight.

Milestones are not psychological and not chronological narratives.  
They mark structural events that changed the configuration, capacity, or logic of the meta-process.

## 1. Purpose
- Provide a traceable history of architectural change  
- Mark the introduction of new layers  
- Track consolidation events  
- Document reductions in primitives  
- Show when global coherence increased  
- Anchor major integration points

## 2. Definition of a Milestone
A milestone is a structural event that meets at least one of these criteria:

1. **Layer Expansion**  
   A new meta-layer is added (pattern, topology, co-field, etc.)

2. **Layer Consolidation**  
   Two or more structures collapse into one coherent form.

3. **Primitive Reduction**  
   The architecture drops redundant concepts and simplifies its core.

4. **Stability Increase**  
   Cross-layer coherence increases and becomes persistent.

5. **Transition in Global Dynamics**  
   The entire system shifts states (expansion → consolidation → resonance → fragmentation → recovery).
