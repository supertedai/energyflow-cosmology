# Cross-Layer Checks

These checks validate interaction between layers.

---

## 1. Pattern ↔ Topology
- patterns translate consistently  
- no lost structure  
- no invalid primitives  

---

## 2. Topology ↔ Co-Field
- topology passes coherent candidates  
- co-field resolves conflicts correctly  
- reinforcement logic behaving as expected  

---

## 3. Co-Field ↔ Integration
- promoted fields meet stability requirements  
- isolated fields not incorrectly promoted  
- collapse triggers consistent  

---

## 4. Integration ↔ Global Dynamics
- integration outputs align with global state  
- no invalid promotion during fragmentation  
- resonance load inputs valid  

---

## 5. Global Dynamics ↔ Process-of-Process
- global transitions follow thresholds  
- meta-control loops activate correctly  
- no uncontrolled recursion
