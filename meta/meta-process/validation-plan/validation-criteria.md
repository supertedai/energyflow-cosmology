# Validation Criteria

These criteria define what the architecture must satisfy to be considered valid.

---

## 1. Structural Criteria
- all layers maintain functional boundaries  
- transitions obey defined rules  
- no unresolved recursion  
- primitives remain minimal and consistent  

---

## 2. Coherence Criteria
- cross-layer coherence above threshold  
- alignment persists during state changes  
- no contradictory structural signals  

---

## 3. Stability Criteria
- stable states last minimum required duration  
- collapse events remain isolated  
- no recurrent fragmentation loops  

---

## 4. Load Criteria
- structural load within safe operating limits  
- resonance load not exceeding warning threshold  
- load fluctuations remain predictable  

---

## 5. Consistency Criteria
- naming conventions consistent  
- semantic identifiers aligned  
- JSON-LD vocabulary stable  

---

## 6. Diagnostic Criteria
- Self-Evaluation responds to drift  
- no missed anomaly detection  
- warning → correction pipeline intact
