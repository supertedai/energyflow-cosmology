# Examples

## Example 1 — Failed Cross-Layer Transition
Topology promotes unstable field  
→ Co-Field rejects  
→ Validation flags failed transition.

---

## Example 2 — Stability Test Failure
System fails to recover from controlled overload  
→ Validation identifies missing collapse isolation.

---

## Example 3 — Semantic Inconsistency
Identifier mismatch detected in JSON-LD  
→ Validation reports naming inconsistency.

---

## Example 4 — Incorrect Global Transition
Global Dynamics entered consolidation prematurely  
→ Validation highlights threshold misconfiguration.
