# Test Methods

These methods define how each part of the architecture is tested.

---

## 1. Structural Testing
- rule consistency  
- boundary integrity  
- primitive correctness  

Method: structural walkthrough.

---

## 2. Coherence Testing
- measure cross-layer alignment  
- compare expected vs. observed behaviour  

Method: coherence metrics test.

---

## 3. Load Testing
- simulate structural load  
- detect overload  
- measure recovery dynamics  

Method: controlled resonance injection.

---

## 4. Transition Testing
- run synthetic transitions  
- verify threshold conditions  
- check output correctness  

Method: state-machine simulation.

---

## 5. Stability Testing
- push architecture into near-fragmentation  
- verify recovery  
- test collapse boundary  

Method: stability stress test.

---

## 6. Semantic Testing
- validate JSON-LD  
- verify identifier uniqueness  
- confirm schema alignment  

Method: semantic scan.
