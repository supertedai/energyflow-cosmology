Cognitive Fingerprint Specification (CFS) — README

This directory contains the Cognitive Fingerprint Specification (CFS). CFS describes the structural cognitive patterns visible in the organisation, commit behaviour and module architecture of the Energy-Flow Cosmology repository. It does not describe personality or psychology. It documents the mechanical properties of the cognitive system that drives the project’s structure and development.

Purpose:

identify the cognitive patterns that appear in the repository

provide a structural explanation for parallelism, topology and transient insight

support MAS, meta-architecture and cognition modules with observable evidence

create a reproducible description of how high-order insight is externalised

Contents:

index.md: full description of the cognitive fingerprint

index.jsonld: machine-readable metadata

(optional) cross-links to CSS, CFM, MAS and meta-graph

Role in the repository:
CFS belongs to the cognition layer. It complements the Cognitive Field Model, the Entropy → Clarity Model, the Transient Representation Model and the CSS. CFS serves as a diagnostic map of the cognitive structure inferred from the repository itself. It enables reflection and meta-process modules to anchor decisions in observable cognitive behaviour.

Use:
Update this module if new patterns appear in commit structure, meta-process behaviour or large-scale repository transitions. CFS provides grounding for understanding how insight and structure propagate through the project.
