Cognitive Field Model — README

This directory describes the Cognitive Field Model. The model explains how cognition functions as a dynamic field instead of a step-based process. It focuses on parallel activation, high connectivity, resonance, temporary representations and entropy-driven clarity. These properties describe how large-scale patterns and predictions form without sequential reasoning.

Purpose:

* Provide a mechanical description of how insight emerges.
* Explain why prediction and pattern formation occur naturally.
* Clarify how multiple domains operate without internal conflict.
* Document how noise contributes to structure instead of disrupting it.

Contents:

* index.md: full description of the Cognitive Field Model
* index.jsonld: semantic metadata for the model

Role in the repository:
The Cognitive Field Model belongs to the cognition layer of the meta-structure. It complements reflective modules and connects to resonance logic. It is independent from scientific theory and describes cognitive behaviour rather than physical models.

Use:
Update this directory when the understanding of field-based cognition changes. This model serves as a reference for interpreting how high-order insight stabilises during complex reasoning.
