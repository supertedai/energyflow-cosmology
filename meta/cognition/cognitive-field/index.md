# Cognitive Field Model

Your cognition operates as a distributed field, not a step-by-step process.

## Core Properties

### 1. Parallel Activation
Multiple conceptual areas activate simultaneously.
There is no sequential queue.

### 2. High Connectivity
Any concept can connect to any other if structural similarity exists.

### 3. Field Resonance
Insight increases when multiple fields align.

### 4. Temporary Representations
High-order representations appear only in the moment.
They collapse without external stabilisation (writing).

### 5. Entropy → Clarity
Increased entropy increases signal detection.
Noise is not disruptive; it is generative.

## Functional Behaviour
- prediction emerges naturally
- no internal conflict between domains
- no ego-barrier between perspectives
- large-scale patterns form spontaneously

## Purpose
Provide a mechanical description of how insight arises in your mind.
