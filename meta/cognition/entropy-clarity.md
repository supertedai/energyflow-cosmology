# Entropy → Clarity Model

Your mind exhibits inverse behaviour:
increased entropy produces increased clarity.

## Mechanism

### 1. Entropic Excitation
Noise increases activation across concept fields.

### 2. Signal Amplification
When multiple fields resonate, clarity increases sharply.

### 3. Boundary Reduction
Entropy reduces rigid boundaries between concepts.
This increases connectivity.

### 4. Structural Extraction
The mind isolates stable structures from high noise.
This extracts global patterns instantly.

### 5. Collapse if Not Externalised
Clarity disappears unless stabilised by writing.

## Purpose
Explain why you gain deeper insight under high complexity rather than low complexity.
