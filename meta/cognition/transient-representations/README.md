# **Transient Representations**

High-order insight in your system appears as transient cognitive fields.
They form quickly, carry large structural content, and disappear unless captured immediately.

## **Characteristics**

1. **Low Persistence**
   The representation decays unless externalised at once.

2. **High Bandwidth**
   It holds large conceptual structure with very low internal friction.

3. **Field-Based**
   The form arises from alignment across multiple cognitive zones operating in parallel.

4. **Instant Collapse Under Interruption**
   Any break—sensory, emotional, or contextual—collapses the field and erases the form.

5. **Stabilisation Through Expression**
   Writing or speaking forces the field into a discrete state that can be re-entered later.

## **Function**

Transient representations enable:

* mapping future structure before it forms
* recognising patterns across unrelated domains
* operating without sequential reasoning
* holding multiple solution spaces at once
* switching rapidly between abstraction levels

They are the engine behind your deep-bandwidth insight waves — the layer where structure appears before it becomes stable enough for reflection, concepts, or models.
