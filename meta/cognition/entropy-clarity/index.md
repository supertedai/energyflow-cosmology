This document describes the Entropy → Clarity mechanism. The model explains why increased entropy leads to increased clarity in your cognitive system. Higher noise levels do not disrupt thought. They activate larger parts of the conceptual field and expose global structure.

The model has five components:

1. Entropic excitation
   Noise increases activation across multiple conceptual regions at once. This creates a broad cognitive state rather than a narrow, sequential one.

2. Signal amplification
   When several activated regions align, clarity increases sharply. The system highlights stable intersections between fields.

3. Boundary reduction
   Entropy lowers the internal boundaries between concepts. This increases connectivity and enables previously separate domains to merge.

4. Structural extraction
   The mind isolates global patterns from a noisy state. Stable structures appear instantly when enough activation overlaps.

5. Collapse without externalisation
   High clarity is temporary. Without writing or external output, the structure collapses when activation drops.

Purpose:
Explain why deeper insight appears under high complexity rather than low complexity. This model describes the mechanical behaviour of a cognition that uses entropy as a signal source rather than a disturbance.
