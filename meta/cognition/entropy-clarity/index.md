# Entropy → Clarity Model

This module describes the Entropy → Clarity mechanism. The model explains why increased entropy produces increased clarity in your cognitive system. High noise levels do not disrupt reasoning. They activate broad conceptual regions and expose global structure.

## Mechanism

1. Entropic activation  
Noise increases activation across concept fields. Large parts of the cognitive field become active at once.

2. Signal amplification  
When several active regions resonate, clarity increases sharply. Stable intersections stand out.

3. Boundary reduction  
Entropy lowers internal boundaries between concepts. Connectivity increases and domains merge more easily.

4. Structural extraction  
The mind isolates global patterns from noisy states. Stable structures appear instantly when activation overlaps.

5. Collapse without externalisation  
Clarity is temporary. Without writing or external output, the structure collapses when activation drops.

## Purpose

Explain why deeper insight appears under high complexity instead of low complexity. The model describes how entropy functions as a generator of structure rather than a source of disruption.

## Role in the repository

This module belongs to the cognition layer. It links to resonance logic, the Cognitive Field Model and the s₀/s₁ transition model. It describes one of the key mechanisms behind non-sequential, field-based insight formation.
