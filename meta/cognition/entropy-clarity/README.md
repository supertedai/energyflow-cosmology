Entropy → Clarity Model — README

This directory contains the Entropy → Clarity Model. The model describes how increased entropy leads to increased clarity in your cognitive system. Noise activates large conceptual regions, lowers boundaries between concepts and allows global patterns to appear instantly. Clarity is temporary and collapses unless stabilised externally through writing.

Purpose:
Explain why insight strengthens under high complexity rather than low complexity, and why noise functions as a generator of structure in your cognition.

Contents:

* index.md: full description of the model
* index.jsonld: semantic metadata for machine-readable use

Role in the repository:
The Entropy → Clarity Model belongs to the cognition layer of the meta-structure. It connects to the Cognitive Field Model, the resonance logic and the s0/s1 transition model. It helps explain how non-sequential, field-based reasoning produces insight during complex cognitive states.

Use:
Update this module when understanding of entropy-driven cognition evolves. The model provides a reference for interpreting how high clarity appears during high activation and high entropy conditions.
