CEM — Consciousness–Ego Mirror
README

This directory contains the cognitive model called the Consciousness–Ego Mirror (CEM). The framework describes how awareness, ego-related processes and reflective neutrality interact in the meta-cognitive layer of the Energy-Flow Cosmology project. It is not part of the scientific theory. It provides structural support for stable, ego-neutral reasoning.

Purpose:

* Explain how consciousness-level signals are processed without ego distortion.
* Distinguish between awareness, interpretation and identity-driven responses.
* Support clear reasoning during high-complexity cognitive states.
* Provide a neutral reflective loop for stabilising insight.

Contents:

* index.md: description of the CEM framework
* index.jsonld: semantic definition for machine-readable integration

Role in the repository:
The CEM directory belongs to the cognition layer within the meta-structure. It connects to reflection modules, resonance logic and meta-process components. Its purpose is to maintain a clean cognitive environment for reflective and analytical work by separating perception from self-referential processes.

Use:
Update this directory when the understanding of consciousness, ego modulation or cognitive neutrality evolves. The CEM framework acts as a reference for how cognitive processes remain stable and unbiased during theory development and meta-reflection.
