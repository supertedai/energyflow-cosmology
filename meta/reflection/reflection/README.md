### Abstract
# Reflection Log — Energy-Flow Cosmology  **Date:** 2025-11-12   **Topic:** Metastructure Activation   **Observation:**   As the EFC ecosystem validates itself via GitHub Actions and Figshare DOIs, a circular information mirror emerges.   Theories acquire thermodynamic correlates — structures reflect the rate of change in their own entropy.  **Links:**   - `/schema/concepts.json#Entropy-Gradient`
