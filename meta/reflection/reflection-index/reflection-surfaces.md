# Reflection Surfaces

Reflection occurs across specific surfaces in the architecture.

---

## 1. Intralayer Surfaces
- pattern → topology  
- topology → co-field  
- co-field → integration  
- integration → global dynamics  

Reflection reads the boundary behaviour.

---

## 2. Interlayer Surfaces
- layer alignment  
- layer drift  
- layer tension  

---

## 3. Global Surfaces
- global coherence  
- system load  
- transition potential  
- stability gradient  

---

## 4. Meta-Surfaces
- recursion boundary  
- architectural drift  
- meta-process alignment
