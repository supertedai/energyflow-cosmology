# Examples

## Example 1 — Local Reflection
Surface: topology → co-field  
Result: identifies misalignment in candidate promotion.

---

## Example 2 — Global Reflection
Surface: global dynamics  
Result: system nearing fragmentation threshold.

---

## Example 3 — Meta Reflection
Surface: recursion boundary  
Result: reflective cycle within tolerance.
