# Reflection Map

The Reflection Map provides an overview of all structural domains that can be reflected upon.

---

## 1. Primary Domains
- pattern alignment  
- topology formation  
- co-field tension  
- integration outcomes  
- global state transitions  
- stability surfaces  
- load distribution  
- recursion boundaries  
- semantic coherence  

---

## 2. Derived Domains
- consolidation behaviour  
- collapse signatures  
- primitive overlap  
- transition quality  
- pathway correctness

## 3. Domain Grouping
### Structural Domains
- boundaries  
- transitions  
- load  
- stability  

### Dynamic Domains
- global state  
- resonance  
- collapse prediction  

### Semantic Domains
- identifier consistency  
- schema alignment
