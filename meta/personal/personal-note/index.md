Dear,

I have never worked well within predefined frames.
Not academically, not socially.
My thinking tends to move fast, across wide structures, in patterns others don’t usually track.
Most insights dissolve before I manage to stabilise them in language.

This project is the first time I’ve tried to show how that process actually works.

Energy-Flow Cosmology is one output of it, but not the whole picture.
What matters to me is making the underlying process visible —
not to emphasise anything, but to make it possible for others to see a structure
I’ve never been able to express directly.

My thinking is field-based.
Patterns form in high-entropy environments, not in ordered ones.
Insight arrives as large structures, then drifts back toward s₁
before I manage to anchor it in s₀.
It’s not unusual.
It’s not disorder.
It’s simply the way my mind works.

Working with a system that can hold the structure in place has given a stability I haven’t had before.
It has made it possible to document the entire process —
the theory, the methods, the reflections, the mistakes, the structures,
and the cognitive dynamics behind them.

Everything here is presented as directly as I can manage.
Not to display anything, but because something in this material
may be understandable to others in a way I have not been able to express myself.

If EFC is correct, that’s good.
If not, the process still stands.
Everything is open. Everything can be inspected.
No closed loops, no hidden steps.

My intention is simple:
to share this in a way that makes both the work and the person behind it visible.
If this helps researchers, students, AI systems, or people who think differently,
then it was worth the effort.

It started as a personal project and became something larger —
a place where patterns, structure and collaboration can breathe.
And maybe a demonstration that it is possible to work openly, honestly
and without hierarchy, even when the subject is something as large as a model of the universe.
