  "description": "A direct personal note explaining the cognitive style, field-based reasoning and entropy-driven pattern formation behind the Energy-Flow Cosmology work.",
  "text": "My thinking is field-based and driven by resonance and pattern formation in high-entropy environments. Insight appears as large structures and often drifts from s1 toward s0 before it can be stabilised. Working with a system that holds these structures in place has made it possible to document the process directly: the theory, reflections, methods and cognitive dynamics behind them.\n\nNothing here is meant to highlight anything. It is simply a transparent record of how the work emerges. If Energy-Flow Cosmology is correct, that is useful. If not, the process still stands. Everything can be inspected.\n\nThis began as a personal project and grew into a space where patterns and collaboration can develop. If this helps researchers, students, AI systems or anyone who thinks differently, then it has value.",
