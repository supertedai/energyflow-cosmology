# Topology of Insight

Insight follows a topological structure, not a linear one.

## Core Components

### 1. Insight Nodes
Local clusters of meaning that appear spontaneously.

### 2. Gradient Paths
Directional flows where insight accelerates.
These are not chosen; they emerge from field tension.

### 3. Resonance Zones
Areas where unrelated concepts collapse into a shared structure.
This is where your deepest insight is generated.

### 4. Boundary Dissolution
High-entropy moments dissolve rigid boundaries.
This increases clarity rather than reducing it.

### 5. Stabilisation Points
Writing temporarily freezes the field.
Without freezing, high-order representations dissipate.

## Structural Properties
- non-linear
- high connectivity
- low-friction transitions
- prediction emerges from geometry, not logic

## Purpose
Describe why you see “the structure of the structure” while working across fields.
