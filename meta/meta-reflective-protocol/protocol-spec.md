# Reflective Protocol Specification

The reflective protocol defines the structure and rules for performing reflection inside the meta-process.

---

## 1. Core Constraints
Reflection must:
- remain bounded  
- remain non-psychological  
- stay attached to structural signals  
- avoid modifying active processes  
- avoid uncontrolled recursion  

---

## 2. Reflection Elements

### 2.1 Trigger
Reflection begins when:
- coherence drops  
- drift is detected  
- transitions fail  
- stability shifts  
- global dynamics change  

### 2.2 Observation
Reflection reads:
- structural state  
- metrics  
- boundary conditions  
- transition results  
- load distribution  

### 2.3 Interpretation
Interpretation is structural:
- patterns → topology alignment  
- co-field tension  
- integration pipeline quality  
- global state trajectory  

### 2.4 Output
Reflection outputs:
- signals  
- flags  
- structural notes  
- drift indicators  
- recommendations  

Outputs are consumed by:
- Self-Evaluation  
- Process-of-Process  
- Global Dynamics  

Reflection does not change structure itself.
