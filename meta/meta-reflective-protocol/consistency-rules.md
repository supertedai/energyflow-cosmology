# Consistency Rules

Reflection must follow predictable rules.

---

## Rule 1 — Non-Interference
Reflection cannot interfere with active structural processes.

## Rule 2 — Structural Focus
Reflection evaluates system behaviour, not content.

## Rule 3 — Bounded Recursion
Reflection may not recurse beyond defined depth.

## Rule 4 — Deterministic Output
Reflection outputs must follow consistent format.

## Rule 5 — Valid Consumers
Only:
- Self-Evaluation  
- Global Dynamics  
- Process-of-Process  
may consume reflective output.
