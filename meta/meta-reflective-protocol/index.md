# Meta-Reflective Protocol

The Meta-Reflective Protocol defines how reflection occurs inside the meta-architecture.  
It ensures that reflection remains structural, stable, and non-psychological.  
It specifies how the system examines itself without altering content or collapsing into semantic drift.

This protocol governs **how reflection is performed**, not what is reflected upon.

---

## 1. Purpose
- define reflection as a controlled structural operation  
- ensure non-psychological, non-emotive reflection  
- regulate how the system examines its own states  
- maintain boundary integrity during introspection  
- provide safe pathways for structural self-observation  
- prevent recursion instability during reflection  

---

## 2. Scope
Reflection applies to:
- coherence conditions  
- transitions  
- load distribution  
- stability patterns  
- architectural drift  
- meta-process performance  

Reflection does *not* modify structure directly.  
It informs:  
- Self-Evaluation  
- Process-of-Process  
- Global Dynamics

## 3. Key Properties of Reflection
- bounded recursion  
- structural neutrality  
- separation from content  
- no psychological interpretation  
- consistent execution path
