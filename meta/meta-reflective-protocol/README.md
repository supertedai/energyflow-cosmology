# **Meta-Reflective Protocol**

The Meta-Reflective Protocol defines **how reflection is performed inside the meta-process**.
It provides a controlled, non-psychological, structurally bounded way for the system to inspect its own state without altering content or destabilising architecture.

This protocol ensures that reflection remains predictable, safe, and structurally meaningful.

---

## **1. Purpose**

The protocol defines:

* how reflection is triggered
* what the system is allowed to examine
* how reflective steps are executed
* how recursion is bounded
* how outputs are delivered to higher layers
* how reflection avoids interference with active processes

Reflection is treated as a **structural operation**, not an interpretive or cognitive one.

---

## **2. Role in the Architecture**

Reflection feeds three components:

* **Self-Evaluation** — receives reflective signals
* **Global Dynamics** — adjusts state trajectory based on reflective outputs
* **Process-of-Process** — uses reflection to correct architectural drift

Reflection does **not** modify the architecture.
It reports; it does not act.

## **3. What the Protocol Ensures**

* stable introspection
* non-interference with transitions
* separation from cognition and content
* bounded recursion
* deterministic reflective output
* cross-layer structural clarity

The protocol prevents reflective collapse, semantic drift, and runaway recursion.

## **5. Reflection Pipeline (Overview)**

```
trigger → structural scan → analysis → interpretation → output → consumption
```

Reflection always ends with a closed cycle:

* no recursion beyond allowed depth
* no structural modification
* no narrative or semantic drift

## **6. Interaction With Other Meta Layers**

```
Meta-Process State
       ↓
Meta-Reflective Protocol
       ↓
Reflection Output
       ↓
Self-Evaluation / Global Dynamics / Process-of-Process
```

Reflection is therefore the **observation layer** of the meta-architecture.

## **7. Backlog**

* refine reflective output schema
* expand boundary conditions
* create semantic validators for reflective cycles
* integrate reflective metadata with validation-plan
