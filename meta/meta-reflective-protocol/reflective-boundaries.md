# Reflective Boundaries

Reflection cannot cross specific boundaries.

---

## 1. Disallowed Domains
Reflection must not:
- enter cognition  
- alter content  
- engage psychological frames  
- modify model narratives  
- produce semantic bias  

---

## 2. Structural Boundaries
Reflection must not:
- adjust transitions  
- trigger global dynamics  
- alter thresholds  
- modify architecture  

These operations belong to Process-of-Process.

---

## 3. Recursion Boundaries
- maximum depth = 1 upward step  
- no downward recursive rewriting  
- no reflective loops inside reflective loops  

---

## 4. Temporal Boundaries
Reflection occurs:
- after transitions  
- during stability checks  
- before consolidation  
- not continuously
