# Reflective Steps

Reflection proceeds through a controlled sequence.

---

## Step 1 — Initialise
- confirm trigger  
- load structural state snapshot  

## Step 2 — Scan
- read coherence  
- read boundaries  
- read load  
- read global state  

## Step 3 — Analyse
- compare to thresholds  
- identify deviations  
- detect anomalies  

## Step 4 — Interpret
- match patterns against known structural signatures  
- determine category of issue  

## Step 5 — Report
- generate structured reflection output  
- deliver to Self-Evaluation and others  

## Step 6 — Close
- ensure recursion bounds intact  
- finalise cycle
