Energy-Flow Cosmology (EFC)

## Overview  
Short summary of how human reasoning and AI structural support co-develop the EFC project.

---

## Key Points

### 1. Shared Context  
AI integrates:

- repository  
- schema  
- workflows  
- previous dialogue  
- methodological notes  

### 2. Bidirectional Loop  
Human and model refine:

- structure  
- documentation  
- workflows  
- logic  

### 3. Multi-Domain Integration  
The process spans:

- theory  
- code  
- validation  
- semantic graph  
- automation  

### 4. Roles  
Human: scientific reasoning  
AI: structural consistency  

### 5. Boundaries  
AI does not generate theory or claims.

### 6. Value  
Supports transparency, reproducibility, and semantic traceability.
