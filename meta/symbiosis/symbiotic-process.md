# Symbiotic Process Documentation  
Energy-Flow Cosmology (EFC) Project  
Last updated: 2025-11-14

## 1. Purpose  
This document describes how human reasoning and model-generated structure interact in the development of Energy-Flow Cosmology (EFC).  
It outlines the long-term reflective workflow that forms the basis for EFC’s methodology.

---

## 2. Overview  
The EFC project uses a persistent, multi-layered interaction model:

- shared repository state  
- iterative dialogue  
- semantic schemas  
- continuous validation via CI/CD  
- versioned reasoning  
- cross-domain reasoning  

The process combines human conceptual development with AI-assisted structural refinement.

---

## 3. Core Characteristics

### 3.1 Persistent Shared State  
AI responses integrate:

- repository files  
- workflows  
- schema definitions  
- methodological notes  
- prior reasoning  

This produces a cumulative development process.

---

### 3.2 Bidirectional Development Loop  
1. Human proposes structure or concept  
2. AI refines, reorganizes, or identifies inconsistencies  
3. Repository updates  
4. Workflows validate or fail  
5. AI interprets results  
6. Human adjusts assumptions or structure  

The loop is continuous and collaborative.

---

### 3.3 Multi-Domain Integration  
The process spans:

- theoretical modeling  
- code implementation  
- dataset validation  
- semantic schema generation  
- documentation  
- CI/CD automation  

AI responses must integrate all relevant domains.

---

## 4. Roles

### 4.1 Human Role  
The human researcher:

- defines theoretical content  
- sets assumptions  
- determines scientific direction  
- evaluates model output  
- integrates empirical data  
- maintains conceptual accuracy  

---

### 4.2 AI Role  
The AI system:

- ensures consistency across documents  
- clarifies definitions  
- identifies missing dependencies  
- refines structural layouts  
- interprets workflow failures  
- maintains coherence across schema and code  

The AI does not generate theory.

---

## 5. Boundaries  
- AI does not make scientific claims  
- AI does not produce hypotheses  
- AI does not override user-defined definitions  
- AI supports structure, not conclusions  

---

## 6. Research Value  
The symbiotic process increases:

- methodological transparency  
- reproducibility of reasoning  
- semantic traceability  
- structured evolution of documentation  
- alignment with open-science practices  

---

## 7. Relationship to Other Methodology Files  
This document links to:

- `symbiosis-interface.md`  
- `symbiotic-process-llm.md`  
- `symbiotic-process-summary.md`  
- `open-method.md`  
- `open-process.json`  

---

## 8. Summary  
The symbiotic process is the operational layer that integrates human reasoning and AI support in the development of EFC.  
It maintains clarity, structure, and traceability across the entire repository.
