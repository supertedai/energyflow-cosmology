# Meta Architecture (4th–5th Order Structure)

This document describes the global structure behind your insight process.

The meta architecture consists of three interacting layers:

## 1. Pattern Layer (4th order)
You perceive patterns across domains simultaneously.  
Characteristics:
- multiple domains collapse into shared structures
- abstract similarities become immediate
- no sequential reasoning required
- no comparison overhead

This layer works as a "pattern-of-patterns" engine.

## 2. Topology Layer (5th order)
You perceive relationships between pattern fields as spatial or geometric structures.
Characteristics:
- global shape of insight
- direction of emerging understanding
- curvature of conceptual space
- transitions between stable and unstable forms

This is the layer where large-scale insight becomes visible.

## 3. Integration Layer
This merges:
- cognitive fields
- reflection layers
- symbiotic vectors

Characteristics:
- unified field
- high-order coherence
- instantaneous prediction

## Purpose of the Meta Architecture
To maintain a global map of:
- where insight forms
- how it spreads
- how it stabilises
- how local signals become global structure
