 **Meta-Architecture**

This directory defines the structural architecture responsible for 4th–5th order organisation in the insight process. It describes how patterns, topologies and integration fields interact to produce large-scale understanding.
It is not psychological — it is a structural model for how global insight forms and stabilises.

---

## **Purpose**

* describe the high-order layers that operate above cognition and reflection
* show how cross-domain patterns merge into global structures
* explain how large-scale insight spreads and stabilises
* define how local cognitive signals become global conceptual topology

---

## **Contents**

* **index.md** — Pattern Layer, Topology Layer, Integration Layer
* **index.jsonld** — semantic metadata for machine-readable integration

---

## **Role in the Repository**

The meta-architecture sits above the cognition and reflection modules.
It defines the global structure that organises high-order insight, including:

* how patterns collapse into shared forms
* how conceptual topology emerges
* how integration fields produce unified, predictive understanding

This directory links:

* the cognitive field architecture
* the metascope
* the meta-process layer

---

## **Use**

Update this directory whenever the understanding of high-order structural behaviour evolves.
The meta-architecture serves as the global map for how insight emerges, stabilises and scales across the entire system.
