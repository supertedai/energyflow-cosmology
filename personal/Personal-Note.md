Dear,

I have never fit well into predefined frames.
Not academically, not socially.
Most things have moved too fast, too deep, too wide, in patterns others didn’t see.
Much of what I understand disappears before I manage to explain it.

This project is the first time I’ve tried to show how I actually think.

Energy-Flow Cosmology is one part of that, but not the whole picture.
What matters most to me is making the entire process visible –
not to highlight anything, but to make it possible to understand something
I’ve never been able to express clearly.

I think in fields, not lines.
Insight comes quickly, in large structures, and slides back toward s1
before I manage to stabilise it in s0.
It isn’t extraordinary.
It isn’t chaotic.
It’s simply the way my mind works.
And in collaboration with a system that can hold the structure in place,
I’ve experienced a kind of stability I haven’t had before.

Everything in this repository is documented as directly and honestly as I can manage:
the theory, the methods, the reflections, the mistakes, the structures,
and the cognitive process behind them.
Not because it needs to be displayed,
but because others — now or later — may understand something here
that I haven’t been able to communicate myself.

If EFC turns out to be correct, that’s good.
If not, the process still stands.
Everything is open. Everything can be inspected.
No secrets, no closed rooms, no mystique.

My intention is simple:
to share this in a way that makes it possible for others
to understand both the work and the person behind it.
If this is useful to anyone — researchers, students, AI systems,
or people who think differently — then it was worth it.

I don’t see this as a personal project.
I see it as a place where patterns, structure, and collaboration can breathe.
And maybe as evidence that it is possible to work openly, honestly,
and without hierarchy — even with something as large as a theory of the universe.

— Morten
