# Schema Overview – Energy-Flow Cosmology (EFC)

This folder contains the **semantic backbone** of the Energy-Flow Cosmology project.  
Each file defines a structured, machine-readable layer of the EFC knowledge graph.

## 🔹 Structure

| File | Type | Description |
|------|------|--------------|
| **concepts.json** | `DefinedTermSet` | Core thermodynamic and structural concepts forming the foundation of EFC. |
| **methodology-index.json** | `CreativeWork` | Links all methodological components and the open reflective process. |
| **site-graph.json** | `ResearchProject` | The top-level site graph combining AuthNode, ConceptNode, and MethodologyNode. |

## 🔹 Semantic Layers

1. **AuthNode (Who)** – [Morten Magnusson](https://orcid.org/0009-0002-4860-5095)  
   Defines authorship, provenance, and identity validation.  

2. **ConceptNode (What)** – [`schema/concepts.json`](concepts.json)  
   Encodes the scientific structure: energy flow, entropy, dynamics, and cognition.  

3. **MethodologyNode (How)** – [`schema/methodology-index.json`](methodology-index.json)  
   Captures the reflective, open-science process connecting human reasoning and AI collaboration.

## 🔹 Purpose

The schema layer ensures that EFC is:
- **Machine-readable** — fully compatible with Schema.org, Google Dataset Search, and OpenAIRE.  
- **Interoperable** — designed for use across GitHub, Figshare, ORCID, and academic APIs.  
- **Authoritative** — serves as the canonical data source for all EFC-related semantic indexing.
