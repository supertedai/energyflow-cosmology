# EFC-H: Expansion Rate Mapping

The expansion rate emerges from the energy-flow potential and entropy:

\[
H = \sqrt{|E_f|} \, (1 + S)
\]

This expression contains the entire cosmological mapping:

- **Low-entropy early Universe** → rapid expansion  
- **Entropy growth** drives structure and slows expansion  
- No dark energy is required  

**Properties**

### 1. Early-structure emergence
High Ef in low-S zones reproduces:
- early galaxies (JWST)
- compact massive structures

### 2. Hubble tension
Entropy-sensitive H solves the local/global mismatch.
