# Energy-Flow Cosmology — Core Equation Set

This document presents the complete mathematical foundation of
**Energy-Flow Cosmology (EFC)** as implemented in `/src/`.

It covers four layers:

1. EFC-S — Entropy Field & Gradient  
2. EFC-D — Energy-Flow Potential  
3. EFC-H — Expansion Mapping  
4. EFC-Φ — Structure Formation & Rotation Curves
