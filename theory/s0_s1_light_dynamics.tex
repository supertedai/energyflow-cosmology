\section{s0--s1 Light Propagation Dynamics}

This section describes how variations in the entropy field between the
endpoints $s_0$ and $s_1$ govern the effective speed of light, photon
trajectories and observable timing signatures.

\subsection{Entropy Endpoints}

The entropy field $S(\mathbf{x})$ has two structural endpoints:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{$s_0$}: low--entropy, high--structure, focusing regime
    \item \textbf{$s_1$}: high--entropy, structural--loosening, defocusing regime
\end{itemize}

We define:
\[
S_{\text{mid}} = \frac{1}{2}(S_0 + S_1), \qquad
\Delta S = S_1 - S_0,
\qquad
x(S) = \frac{S - S_{\text{mid}}}{\Delta S / 2}.
\]

\subsection{Effective Speed of Light}

The effective light speed is:
\[
c(S) = c_0\left(1 + a_{\text{edge}}\, x(S)^2\right),
\]
with minimum at $S_{\text{mid}}$ and symmetric enhancement toward $s_0$
and $s_1$.

\subsection{Physical Interpretation}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Near $s_0$: increased $c(S)$ produces focusing of photon paths.
    \item Near $s_1$: increased $c(S)$ produces large--scale defocusing.
    \item Mid--entropy: $c(S)$ attains its minimum and sets the baseline propagation regime.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Light Travel Time}

Observable timing is modified by the integral:
\[
t_{\text{obs}}
= \int_\gamma \frac{dl}{c(S(l))},
\]
where $\gamma$ is the photon trajectory and $S(l)$ is the sampled
entropy profile.

\subsection{Consequences for Lensing}

\begin{itemize}
    \item focusing wells near $s_0$
    \item horizon--scale defocusing near $s_1$
    \item modified time--delay ratios
    \item altered redshift--distance relations
\end{itemize}

These effects arise without invoking dark energy or a fixed speed of light.
