\subsection*{Entropy Endpoints}

We define two entropy endpoints:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $s_0$: low-entropy, high-structure endpoint
    \item $s_1$: high-entropy, high-diffusion endpoint
\end{itemize}

The midpoint is
\[
S_{\text{mid}} = \frac{1}{2}(s_0 + s_1),
\]
and the entropy span is
\[
\Delta S = s_1 - s_0.
\]

Define the normalized entropy coordinate:
\[
x(S) = \frac{S - S_{\text{mid}}}{\Delta S/2}.
\]

\subsection*{Speed of Light Variation}

The effective speed of light becomes:
\[
c(S) = c_0 \left( 1 + a_{\text{edge}} x(S)^2 \right).
\]

\subsection*{Light Travel Time}

For a photon moving along a path $\gamma$, the travel time becomes:
\[
t_{\text{obs}} = \int_{\gamma} \frac{dl}{c(S(l))}.
\]

\subsection*{Lensing Behavior}

Low-entropy endpoints act as focusing wells;  
high-entropy endpoints contribute to large-scale defocusing.

This generates a dual-lens profile consistent with observed halo asymmetries.
