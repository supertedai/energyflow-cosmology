\section{Light Dynamics Near the s$_0$--s$_1$ Endpoints}

Light propagation in EFC is modulated by the entropy-dependent speed
\[
c(S) = c_0 \left(1 + a_{\text{edge}} x(S)^2\right),
\]
where $x(S)$ is the normalized entropy coordinate.

At the endpoints $S_0$ and $S_1$ an enhancement occurs:
\[
c(S_0) > c(S_{\text{mid}}), \qquad
c(S_1) > c(S_{\text{mid}}).
\]

This creates focusing near s$_0$ and defocusing near s$_1$, shaping
lensing geometry, time delays and redshift--distance relations.
