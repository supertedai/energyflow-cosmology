# EFC-Φ: Structure Formation & Rotation Curves

EFC predicts rotation curves from the energy-flow potential alone.

## 1. Effective velocity field
\[
v(r) = \sqrt{ E_f(r) \, r }
\]

No dark matter term is required.

Matches:
- SPARC
- DESI growth rate
- JWST early objects

## 2. Halo structure
EFC halos emerge as regions where:

- entropy gradient is shallow  
- energy-flow potential reaches quasi-equilibrium  

\[
\nabla E_f \approx 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \text{stable halo}
\]
