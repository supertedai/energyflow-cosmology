# s₀–s₁ Light Dynamics in Energy-Flow Cosmology (EFC)

_Last updated: 2025-11-14_

## 1. Setup: Entropy, Energy Flow and c

In EFC, light propagation is governed by:

- the **energy-flow field** Ef
- the **entropy field** S
- the **grid structure** defined by Ef and S

Local “speed of light” c is not a fundamental constant.  
It is a **locally stable propagation speed** emerging from the resistance of the grid, which depends on S.

We write this conceptually as:

- \( c = c(S; E_f) \)

with:

- low resistance → higher effective c  
- high resistance → lower effective c  

Resistance is an entropic property of the grid.

## 2. Endpoints: s₀ and s₁

We define two entropy endpoints:

- **s₀**: low-entropy, high-structure, high energy-density regime  
- **s₁**: high-entropy, low-structure, low energy-density regime  

Both are **dynamic endpoints** of the same energy-flow law, not separate mechanisms.

Qualitative properties:

- near **s₀**:
  - grid is dense and rigid
  - energy flow is highly ordered
  - light is focused inward (gravitational focusing)
- near **s₁**:
  - grid is loose and weak
  - energy flow is diffuse
  - light is defocused outward (gravitational defocusing)

---

## 3. Core Claim: c Increases Near Both s₀ and s₁

From first principles in EFC:

1. Resistance of the grid is controlled by S.
2. As resistance → 0, the effective propagation speed c increases.
3. Both s₀ and s₁ correspond to limit regimes where resistance is reduced:

   - at **s₀**: order is high, dissipation is low  
   - at **s₁**: structure collapses, constraints disappear

Therefore:

- \( c(S) \) must **increase** as S → s₀  
- \( c(S) \) must **increase** as S → s₁  

This produces a **dual-endpoint behaviour**:

- s₀: high-c focusing regime  
- s₁: high-c defocusing regime  

---

## 4. Pop vs Glide Scenarios (s₀ and s₁)

For light approaching either endpoint (s₀ or s₁), there are two generic scenarios:

### 4.1 Pop Scenario

- Light is driven into an extreme region of S (towards s₀ or s₁).
- The grid can no longer maintain the configuration.
- c rises towards its local maximum.
- The photon “pops out” of the region.

Observable consequences:

- sharp change in time delay
- abrupt change in redshift profile
- local anomaly in lensing behaviour (focus/defocus transition)

### 4.2 Glide Scenario

- Entropy changes more slowly.
- Light gradually moves through the S-gradient.
- c changes smoothly as a function of S.
- No sudden break, but a continuous glide in propagation speed.

Observable consequences:

- smooth but non-linear time delay vs path length
- asymmetric in/out trajectories around structures
- gradual drift in redshift beyond ΛCDM expectations

Both scenarios are governed by the **same underlying law** \( c = c(S; E_f) \).

---

## 5. Symmetry: Gravitation and Cosmic Acceleration

In standard cosmology, “gravity” and “cosmic acceleration” require different mechanisms:

- gravity ↔ curvature + mass  
- acceleration ↔ dark energy (Λ)  

In EFC:

- **s₀-side** behaviour (focusing) corresponds to what we call “gravity”
- **s₁-side** behaviour (defocusing) corresponds to what we call “cosmic acceleration”

Both emerge from the **same energy-flow + entropy law**, not from separate fields or substances.

Thus:

- s₀ and s₁ are **two ends of one gradient**, not two unrelated phenomena.

---

## 6. Observational Signatures

If this picture is correct, we should observe:

1. **c-variation signatures** (effective, not absolute):
   - differences in time delay across regions with strong S-gradients
   - asymmetry between incoming and outgoing light paths near massive or highly entropic regions

2. **Lensing asymmetries**:
   - stronger focusing near s₀-like regions than mass alone would predict
   - weaker or defocusing behaviour near s₁-like regions (voids, late-time structures)

3. **Redshift–time anomalies**:
   - strong redshift combined with shorter-than-expected travel times
   - systematic deviations from ΛCDM in H(z) at late times

4. **End-point phenomena**:
   - “pop-like” transitions in extreme environments (cluster cores, SMBH environments, deep voids)
   - “glide-like” behaviour over large cosmological baselines

---

## 7. Falsifiability

The dual-endpoint c(S) behaviour can be falsified if:

- no regime-dependent signatures of effective c-variation are found
- lensing and time-delay behaviour remain fully consistent with a strictly constant c and ΛCDM
- no asymmetric in/out light paths are detected around high-contrast S-structures

If, instead, data reveal consistent deviations that match the s₀–s₁ pattern,  
this mechanism becomes a central predictive feature of EFC.
