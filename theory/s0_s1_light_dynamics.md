# s₀–s₁ Light Propagation Dynamics

This document formalises how the effective speed of light in EFC,
$c(S)$, behaves across the entropy domain bounded by the dynamic
endpoints s₀ and s₁.

## 1. Entropy Endpoints

We define:

- **s₀**: low-entropy, high-structure endpoint  
- **s₁**: high-entropy, structural-loosening endpoint  
- \(S_0, S_1\): corresponding entropy values  
- \(S_{\text{mid}} = \frac{1}{2}(S_0 + S_1)\)  
- \(\Delta S = S_1 - S_0\)

The normalized coordinate is:

\[
x(S) = \frac{S - S_{\text{mid}}}{\Delta S / 2}.
\]

## 2. Effective Speed of Light

The effective propagation speed is:

\[
c(S) = c_0 \left( 1 + a_{\text{edge}} \, x(S)^2 \right),
\]

with:

- minimum at \(S_{\text{mid}}\)  
- increasing smoothly toward both s₀ and s₁  
- no singularities, no discontinuities  
- symmetric in the entropy domain  

## 3. Physical Interpretation

- **Near s₀ (low S):**  
  Strong structure, low grid resistance → c increases → focusing.

- **Mid-entropy bands:**  
  Highest resistance → c minimal → stable structure formation.

- **Near s₁ (high S):**  
  Structural loosening → c increases → defocusing and accelerated paths.

## 4. Photon Dynamics

Photon travel time:

\[
t_{\text{obs}} = \int_{\gamma} \frac{dl}{c(S(l))}.
\]

Consequences:

- Light moves faster in s₀- and s₁-like regions.  
- Time delays change without altering mass distribution.  
- Lensing patterns depend on S-field, not just mass.  
- Redshift–distance relations shift if paths sample non-mid S.  

## 5. System-Level Behaviour

- Regions near s₀ act as focusing wells.  
- Regions near s₁ contribute to horizon-scale defocusing.  
- Mid-band governs structural persistence and halo equilibrium.  
- Symmetry ensures no asymmetric effects unless S-field itself is asymmetric.  

## 6. Summary

c(S) encodes all grid-resistance effects into a single smooth, physical,
entropy-derived propagation law. It is the minimal function consistent
with both focusing near s₀ and defocusing near s₁, and forms a central
component of the entire EFC structure.
