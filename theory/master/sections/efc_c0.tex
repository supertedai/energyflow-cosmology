\subsection*{Overview}

EFC-C$_0$ describes how information and light interact with entropy through
an effective refractive index. This layer connects EFC to observational
lensing and signal propagation.

\subsection*{Entropy–Refractive Index Relation}

We define:

\[
n(S) = 1 + \alpha S,
\]

where $\alpha$ is the response coefficient.

\subsection*{Local Speed of Light}

Light speed is reduced according to:

\[
c(S) = \frac{c_0}{n(S)}.
\]

\subsection*{Fermat Functional}

Light paths minimize:

\[
\tau = \int n(S) \, ds,
\]

giving an entropy-driven lensing law.

\subsection*{Dual Lensing}

Two effects appear:

\begin{itemize}
    \item geometric deviation
    \item entropy-induced refraction
\end{itemize}

This forms the observational core of EFC lensing.
