\subsection*{Overview}

EFC-D describes cosmic dynamics as the result of energy flow along entropy
gradients. The central quantity is the energy field $E_f(S)$, which varies
with the local entropy density $S$.

\subsection*{Energy–Entropy Relation}

Dynamics arise when:

\[
\nabla S \neq 0
\]

Energy moves toward increasing entropy:

\[
\vec{v}_E = -k \, \nabla S
\]

with $k$ controlling the field response.

\subsection*{Effective Potential}

We define an effective potential:

\[
\Phi_E(S) = -\int E_f(S) \, dS
\]

Acceleration follows as:

\[
\vec{a} = -\nabla \Phi_E .
\]

\subsection*{Expansion Rate}

The expansion rate predicted by EFC-D is:

\[
H(S) = \sqrt{|E_f(S)|} \, (1 + S),
\]

used for comparison with DESI, CMB, and BAO measurements.
