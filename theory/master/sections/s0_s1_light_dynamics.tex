\subsection*{Overview}

The s$_0 \rightarrow$ s$_1$ transition describes how light changes mode of
propagation inside an entropy field.

\subsection*{Propagation Law}

\[
\frac{d\vec{k}}{ds} = -\nabla n(S),
\]

which is optically equivalent to gravitational lensing, but driven by
$\nabla S$ rather than mass.

\subsection*{Coupling Between Layers}

Light follows modified trajectories whenever:

\[
\nabla S \neq 0.
\]

This couples EFC-D (dynamics) and EFC-C$_0$ (refraction) into a unified
signal-propagation model.
