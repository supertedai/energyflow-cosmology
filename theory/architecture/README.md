# Theory Architecture

This directory defines the architectural structure of the Energy-Flow Cosmology (EFC) theory.  
The focus is on how fields, layers and modules fit together as a coherent system.

---

## Overview

EFC is organised into a small set of core components:

- **Fields**
  - Entropy field (S)
  - Energy-flow field (E_f)
  - Grid / resistance structure

- **Base layers**
  - **EFC-S** – structural and halo profiles  
  - **EFC-D** – energy-flow dynamics  
  - **EFC-C₀** – entropy–information mapping  

- **Extensions**
  - Grid–Higgs Framework  
  - IMX informational metastructure  

This directory documents the structure and relationships between these components.

---

## Purpose

- Provide a stable overview of the theory’s architecture.  
- Show dependencies between fields, profiles and dynamics.  
- Serve as a navigation map for LaTeX papers, Figshare DOIs and simulation code.  

---

## Files

- `index.md` — human-readable architecture description  
- `index.jsonld` — machine-readable semantic structure

## Repository placement

```

```

---

## Use

Update this directory when new theory components, layers or frameworks are added.  
This keeps the entire EFC theory consistent, traceable and well-structured.
