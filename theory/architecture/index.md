# EFC Theory Architecture

This directory documents the internal architecture of the Energy-Flow Cosmology (EFC) theory.

The focus is not on detailed equations, but on how the theory is structured as a system of coupled layers, fields and mappings that can be implemented, extended and audited.

---

## 1. Purpose

- Describe the structural layout of the EFC theory.
- Show how core fields, layers and modules connect.
- Provide a stable reference for simulations, papers and meta-documents.
- Make the theory navigable for both humans and machines.

## 2. Position in the repository

This directory belongs to the **theory** layer of the project.

- `/theory/` — formal theory content.
- `/theory/architecture/` — how the theory is organised as an architecture.
- `/meta/` — meta-level descriptions (reflection, cognition, process).
- `/methodology/` — how the work is done (workflow, SRM, reproducibility).

The goal here is to keep a clean map of **what the theory is made of**, not how it was developed.

## 3. Core architectural elements

The EFC theory is organised around a small set of core elements:

- **Fields**
  - Entropy field \(S\)
  - Energy-flow field \(E_f\)
  - Grid / resistance structure (effective medium)

- **Base layers**
  - **EFC-S** — structural / halo-level description.
  - **EFC-D** — energy-flow dynamics on top of these structures.
  - **EFC-C₀** — mapping between entropy, information capacity and signal propagation.

- **Extended frames**
  - **Grid–Higgs Framework** — relation between grid properties and effective mass/interaction.
  - **IMX / informational metastructure** — how information layers sit on top of the physical fields.

This directory should describe **how these elements fit together**, which files define them, and how new components should be attached.

## 4. What belongs here

Typical content for this directory:

- High-level architecture diagrams of the theory.
- Textual descriptions of:
  - Field hierarchy and dependencies.
  - Layered structure (S, D, C₀, extensions).
  - Interfaces between theory modules and simulations.
- Tables that map:
  - Symbols → meaning → file / equation location.
  - Layers → responsible phenomena (e.g. halos, flows, signals).

Equation details and full derivations belong in the relevant theory subdirectories; here you only give enough information to navigate the structure.

## 5. Usage

You can use this directory to:

- Quickly understand **how the theory is put together**.
- Align new LaTeX papers, Figshare articles and code modules with the same architecture.
- Keep a single source of truth for:
  - Names of layers and fields.
  - Their roles.
  - How they connect to observables and simulations.

When you add or change major theoretical components, update this directory first so that the architecture stays coherent over time.
