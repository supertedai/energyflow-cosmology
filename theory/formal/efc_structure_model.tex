\section{EFC-Structure: Formation and Halos}

The structural potential determines the stable configurations
that correspond to halos, filaments and sheets.

\subsection{Effective Structural Equation}

Structure formation is governed by equilibrium solutions of:
\begin{equation}
    \nabla \Phi(E_f, S) = 0.
\end{equation}

Entropy modulates the stability condition:
\begin{equation}
    \nabla \Phi + S \,\nabla S = 0.
\end{equation}

Solutions correspond to EFC halo profiles.
