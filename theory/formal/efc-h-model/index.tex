\section*{EFC-H Model: Halo-Level Structure}

\subsection*{1. Radial Density Profile}

The baseline density profile in EFC is defined as a smooth, monotonic
distribution shaped by the grid-level entropy resistance:

\[
\rho(r) = \rho_0 \, f_\rho(r)
\]

where \( f_\rho(r) \) is a model-dependent attenuation function determined by
local entropy.

A minimal analytic prototype is:

\[
f_\rho(r) = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{r}{r_s}\right)^\alpha}
\]

with scale radius \( r_s \) and slope parameter \( \alpha \).

\subsection*{2. Entropy Profile}

Entropy increases radially due to reduced structural coherence:

\[
S(r) = S_0 + \Delta S(r)
\]

A typical form is:

\[
\Delta S(r) = 1 - e^{-r/r_s}
\]

so the outer halo approaches maximal entropy.

\subsection*{3. Energy-Flow Potential}

The core dynamical quantity is the energy-flow potential:

\[
E_f(r) = \rho(r)\,[1 - S(r)].
\]

Low-entropy regions keep \(E_f\) high; high-entropy regions suppress it.

This defines the effective gravitational-like behaviour.

\subsection*{4. Rotation Curve}

The circular velocity is derived from the radial gradient of
\(E_f(r)\):

\[
v^2(r) = r\, \frac{dE_f}{dr}.
\]

This reproduces flat rotation curves when entropy grows slowly and suppresses
the inner decline.

\subsection*{5. Lensing Profile}

The lensing mass follows from the projected integral of the effective density:

\[
\Sigma_{\mathrm{eff}}(R) =
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} E_f\!\left(\sqrt{R^2 + z^2}\right) dz.
\]

This defines the observable lensing signature without dark matter.

\subsection*{6. Halo Equilibrium}

Equilibrium occurs when the entropic expansion pressure balances the inward
gradient of \( \rho \):

\[
\nabla \rho(r) + \nabla S(r) = 0.
\]

This provides a self-consistent halo solution driven entirely by
energy–entropy coupling.

\subsection*{7. Summary}

The EFC-H model formalizes:
\begin{itemize}
\item density attenuation via entropy,
\item entropy-driven suppression of energy flow,
\item rotation curves from \( \nabla E_f \),
\item lensing profiles from projected \( E_f \),
\item thermodynamic equilibrium of halo structure.
\end{itemize}

This section forms the structural pillar of Energy-Flow Cosmology.
