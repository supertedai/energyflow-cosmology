# EFC-H Model — Halo-Level Structure

The EFC-H model describes how halo structure forms and stabilizes from the
interaction between density \( \rho(r) \), entropy \( S(r) \), and the
energy-flow potential \( E_f(r) \).

The goal is to define the radial profiles and structural relations that give
rise to rotation curves, lensing signatures and large-scale halo equilibrium
without invoking dark matter components.

## Core Components

- **Density profile**  
  \( \rho(r) \) shaped by the entropic resistance of the grid.

- **Entropy profile**  
  \( S(r) \) controls how energy propagation slows as gradients increase.

- **Energy-flow potential**  
  \( E_f(r) = \rho(r)\,[1 - S(r)] \).

- **Structural coupling**  
  Halo stability follows from the balance between inward \( \rho \)-pressure
  and outward entropic suppression.

## Purpose

This model provides the structural layer of EFC:
- rotational velocity curves,
- lensing mass profiles,
- halo equilibrium conditions,
- link between entropy and apparent mass.
