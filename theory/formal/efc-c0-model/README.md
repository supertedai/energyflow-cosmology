# **EFC–C0: Entropy–Information Base Layer**

The C0-layer defines how entropy controls information capacity, propagation resistance, and effective signal speed in Energy-Flow Cosmology (EFC).
This is the foundational mapping used by all higher levels of the theory.

## **1. Information Capacity**

Information capacity decreases as entropy increases.
Low entropy gives high capacity, while high entropy reduces capacity.
This sets the local representational bandwidth of the grid.

---

## **2. Propagation Resistance**

Propagation resistance depends on both entropy and density.
Higher entropy increases resistance, and structural variations modulate it further.
Resistance determines how easily energy, light, and information move through spacetime.

---

## **3. Effective Signal Speed**

Effective propagation speed is controlled by resistance.
Higher resistance lowers the local signal speed.
This defines the behaviour associated with the S0/S1 regimes.

---

## **4. Entropy Regimes**

Two reference regimes are used:

* **S0:** low-entropy regime
* **S1:** high-entropy regime

These regimes appear in the light-speed variation and refractive-index components of EFC.

## **Role in the Full Theory**

The C0-layer feeds into:

* EFC-D (energy-flow dynamics)
* EFC-H (halo rotation and lensing)
* EFC-S (structural background)

The layer itself is static. It defines relationships, not dynamics.
