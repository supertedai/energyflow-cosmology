\section{EFC-H: Expansion Mapping}

The expansion rate $H$ in EFC is not derived from density as in
$\Lambda$CDM, but from the interaction of energy-flow and entropy.

\subsection{Baseline Expansion Law}

The current implementation defines:
\begin{equation}
    H(E_f, S) = A_H \sqrt{|E_f|}\,(1 + S).
\end{equation}

This links:
\begin{itemize}
    \item entropy to redshift evolution,
    \item energy-flow to effective curvature,
    \item structural conditions to expansion behaviour.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Generalized Form}

A more general version can be written as:
\begin{equation}
    H(E_f,S) = A_H |E_f|^{\alpha/2} (1 + S)^\gamma,
\end{equation}
with tunable exponents $\alpha, \gamma$.
