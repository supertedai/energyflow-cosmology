\section{EFC-H: Expansion Mapping}

The expansion mapping $H$ is defined as a function of 
energy-flow and entropy:

\begin{equation}
    H(E_f, S) = A_H \, G(E_f, S).
\end{equation}

The baseline model implemented in 
\texttt{efc\_core.expansion\_rate} uses:

\begin{equation}
    H(E_f, S) = \sqrt{|E_f|}\,(1 + S).
\end{equation}

This expression can be generalized by modifying the 
functional dependence of $G$.
