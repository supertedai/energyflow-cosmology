# EFC-D Model — Energy-Flow Dynamics

This folder defines the dynamical layer of Energy-Flow Cosmology (EFC-D).  
The model describes how the energy-flow field **Eₚ**, the entropy field **S**, and mass density **ρ** interact over space and time.

The focus is on first-principles dynamics:
- definition of the energy-flow potential  
- differential behaviour of Eₚ  
- relationship between density, entropy and flow  
- dynamic profiles used in rotational curves, lensing and structure formation  
- links between EFC-S (structures) and EFC-C₀ (entropy–information mapping)

## Files
- **index.tex** — mathematical specification of the EFC-D model  
- **README.md** — this file

The LaTeX file provides the formal equations and is used in the master documents and compiled PDFs.
