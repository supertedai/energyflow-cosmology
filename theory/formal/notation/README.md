# EFC — Notation

This folder defines the symbols used across all formal EFC models.  
The notation keeps equations consistent across:

- EFC-S (structure)
- EFC-D (dynamics)
- EFC-C₀ (entropy–information mapping)
- Grid–Higgs Framework
- All formal specifications

## Core Symbols

| Symbol | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| \( S \) | Entropy field (scalar) |
| \( \rho \) | Mass–energy density |
| \( E_f \) | Energy-flow potential |
| \( c(S) \) | Effective light-speed as a function of entropy |
| \( n(S) \) | Refractive-index analogue from entropy |
| \( \Phi \) | Structural gravitational potential in EFC-S |
| \( \vec{\nabla} S \) | Entropy gradient |
| \( H_z \) | Local expansion resistance |
| \( \dot{X} \) | Temporal derivative |

## Purpose

All EFC equations reference this notation.  
This avoids conflicts between sub-models and ensures every paper and PDF uses the same symbols.

## Status

Stable. Manually maintained. No scripts modify this folder.
