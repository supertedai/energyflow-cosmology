# EFC Header — Core Definitions

This folder contains the **top-level header block** used across all
formal EFC LaTeX documents. It defines the shared macros,
notation, and formatting required to keep the entire formal
specification consistent.

## Contents
- `index.tex` — LaTeX header with core macros and definitions.
- Shared symbols:
  - Entropy field \(S\)
  - Energy–flow field \(E_f\)
  - Density \(\rho\)
  - Grid resistance functions
  - Information–capacity functions

## Purpose
The header centralizes all notation so every formal EFC document uses
the same mathematical language.

## Status
Stable. Manual only. No auto-scripts interact with this folder.
