# EFC Formal Specification — Core Equations

This folder contains the **canonical mathematical specification** of
Energy-Flow Cosmology (EFC). It defines the variables, fields, and
relationships that form the backbone of the theory.

## Contents
- `index.tex` — Primary LaTeX document with the formal specification.
- Base definitions for:
  - Entropy field \(S(\mathbf{x})\)
  - Energy–flow potential \(E_f\)
  - Density field \(\rho\)
  - Grid resistance profile \(R\)
- Dynamical relationships linking these quantities.

## Purpose
Provides the **authoritative mathematical core** used in:
- EFC Master Specification
- Derived models (EFC-S, EFC-D, EFC-C)
- Simulation modules in `/src/efc/`

## Status
Manually maintained. No automatic scripts modify this folder.
