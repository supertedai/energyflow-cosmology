# Meta-Architecture Section (IMX Layer)

This folder contains the **Informational Meta-Structure Extension (IMX)** of
Energy-Flow Cosmology.  
It defines the high-level architecture that sits above the core physical
models (EFC-S, EFC-D, EFC-C₀) and describes how concepts, relationships,
and structural mappings are organised.

## Purpose
The IMX layer describes:
- concept-level structure
- relational geometry between models
- information ↔ entropy mappings
- cross-layer bindings
- semantic organisation of the EFC framework
- high-level architectural logic used across theory, methodology and cognition

## Contents
- `index.tex` — LaTeX definition of the meta-architecture structure
- Concept relations and structural diagrams
- Mapping between:
  - structural layer (EFC-S)
  - dynamic layer (EFC-D)
  - entropy/information layer (EFC-C₀)
  - extended meta-structure (IMX)
