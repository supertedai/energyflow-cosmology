# EFC-S Model — Structural Layer

This folder defines the structural layer of Energy-Flow Cosmology (EFC-S).  
The model describes how grid-level entropy, density and resistance create the
base structural environment that governs dynamics in EFC-D.

## Contents
- `index.tex` — Formal LaTeX specification of the S-model.
- Structural definitions for:
  - Grid state \(G(x)\)
  - Entropy field \(S(x)\)
  - Density field \(\rho(x)\)
  - Resistance profile \(R(x)\)
  - Baseline structural equation set

## Purpose
Provides the mathematical baseline used by the dynamics layer (EFC-D).  
Establishes fixed notation and structural relations used across all higher-level
EFC documents.

## Status
Stable. Fully manual. No scripts modify this folder.
