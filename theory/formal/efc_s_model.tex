\section{EFC-S: Entropy Field and Gradient}

The EFC-S sector defines the entropy field $S(\mathbf{x})$.
This field encodes local structural organization and acts as a
non-mass-based driver of curvature-like behavior.

\subsection{Entropy Field}

The entropy field is treated as a scalar function:
\begin{equation}
    S : \mathbb{R}^3 \rightarrow [S_{\min}, S_{\max}].
\end{equation}

The field can be interpreted as a measure of information or
organizational density in configuration space.

\subsection{Entropy Gradient}

The entropy gradient is:
\begin{equation}
    \nabla S(\mathbf{x}) = 
    \left(
      \frac{\partial S}{\partial x},
      \frac{\partial S}{\partial y},
      \frac{\partial S}{\partial z}
    \right).
\end{equation}

The scaled physical gradient used in the model is:
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{g}_S = k_S \nabla S.
\end{equation}

This gradient introduces directional asymmetry which couples
to the energy-flow field and affects structure formation.
