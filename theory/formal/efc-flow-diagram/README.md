# EFC Flow Diagram — Structural Overview

This folder contains the **formal diagram specification** of the Energy-Flow
Cosmology process: how structure, energy-flow and entropy interact at each stage.

## Contents
- `index.tex` — LaTeX definition of the flow diagram (boxes, arrows, dependencies).
- Diagram logic for:
  - Grid state → entropy profile
  - Entropy profile → \(E_f\)
  - \(E_f\) → structure formation
  - Cross-feedback loops

## Purpose
Provides the **visual logic layer** of EFC, suitable for:
- Publications
- Formal specification documents
- High-level system diagrams
- Integration into `efc_master.pdf`

## Status
Stable. Fully manual. No auto-generation scripts interact with this folder.
