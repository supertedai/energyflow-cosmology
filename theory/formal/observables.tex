\section{Observables and Validation Mapping}

\subsection{JWST}

EFC predicts early galaxy presence via the 
$(E_f, S)$-dependent structural growth rate.

\subsection{DESI / BAO}

The expansion curve derived from $H(E_f,S)$ maps to 
$H(z)$ and BAO observables.

\subsection{SPARC}

The circular velocity is given by:
\begin{equation}
    v(r) = \sqrt{r \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial r}}.
\end{equation}

This provides direct comparison with rotation curve datasets.
