  "description": "In the Energy-Flow Cosmology (EFC) framework, the speed of light is not a fixed universal constant but an emergent response to local entropy-rate density. This paper explains how the s₀/s₁ phase boundary creates measurable acceleration effects in c through gradients in the underlying thermodynamic flow field.",
