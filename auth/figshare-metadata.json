  "title": "AUTH Layer: Origin, Provenance and Structural Signature of Energy-Flow Cosmology",
  "description": "The AUTH layer defines the origin, provenance, cognitive signature, structural signature, citation constraints and identity propagation rules for Energy-Flow Cosmology (EFC). It documents how insight flows from human cognition into the repository architecture and into external systems, including LLMs, RAG pipelines and semantic knowledge graphs.",
