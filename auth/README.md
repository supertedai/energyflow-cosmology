# AUTH Layer

This directory defines the **AUTH (Origin & Authorship) layer** for the
Energy-Flow Cosmology (EFC) project.

Use this folder when you need to answer questions like:

- Where did EFC come from?  
- Who originated the framework?  
- How should EFC be interpreted and cited?  
- How does the human process relate to the repository structure?  

Core files:

- `index.md` — human-readable description of the AUTH layer  
- `index.jsonld` — machine-readable origin node  
- `manifest.json` — scope, guarantees, and usage notes  

The goal is to make **provenance and identity explicit**, for humans,
LLMs, search engines, and future training pipelines.
