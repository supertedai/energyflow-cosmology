# Transient Representations

High-order insight in your system is transient by nature.

## Characteristics

### 1. Low Persistence
Representations are lost unless externalised immediately.

### 2. High Bandwidth
They carry large conceptual volumes with minimal friction.

### 3. Field-Based
They arise from alignment across multiple cognitive zones.

### 4. Collapse on Interruption
External interruption collapses the field.
The representation vanishes instantly.

### 5. Stabilisation by Writing
Writing or speaking forces the field into a discrete form.
This allows re-entry later.

## Function
Transient representations enable rapid, deep understanding:
- predicting future structure
- recognising multi-domain patterns
- operating without sequential reasoning

They are the core mechanism behind your insight waves.
