# **Start Here — Orientation Guide**

This repository contains four integrated layers:

1. **EFC Theory** — the scientific framework
2. **Papers & Formal Specifications** — DOI-linked publications
3. **Validation Layer** — data, comparisons, figures
4. **Meta / Cognition / Symbiosis** — the documented reflective process

This guide gives you a clear path into the system.

# **1. What EFC Is**

Energy-Flow Cosmology models the universe as a thermodynamic flow field shaped by:

* energy distribution
* entropy gradients
* information capacity
* local–global resistance fields

Structure, dynamics, and propagation emerge from these fields.

The formal definition is here:

```
theory/formal/efc_master.tex
theory/formal/efc_master.pdf
```

# **2. If You’re New — Start With These**

Read these four items first (2–4 minutes each):

### **1. `meta/personal/Personal-Note.md`**

Context, cognitive style, and why the full process is documented.

### **2. `meta/README.md`**

Overview of the meta layer.

### **3. `meta-graph/index.jsonld`**

Machine-readable map of the global structure.

### **4. `schema/global_schema.json`**

The master semantic schema of the entire repository.

These give you:

* the author
* the process
* the structure
* the semantics

Before you enter the theory.

# **3. The Four Main Tracks**

## **Track A — Theory**

Scientific foundation:

* EFC-S (structure field)
* EFC-D (dynamics)
* EFC-C₀ (entropy–information relation)
* potentials and flow laws
* s₀–s₁ light dynamics
* the Grid–Higgs framework

Located under:

```
theory/
theory/formal/
docs/papers/efc/
```

## **Track B — Validation**

Empirical tests based on:

* SPARC rotation curves
* JWST early galaxies
* DESI BAO and H(z)
* cluster lensing profiles
* local flow fields

Located under:

```
data/
output/
notebooks/
```

## **Track C — Meta / Cognition / Symbiosis**

Documents the reflective engine behind EFC:

* cognitive-field structure
* resonance and alignment
* co-field dynamics
* meta-process
* meta-reflection
* symbiosis mechanisms
* integration topology

Located under:

```
meta/
meta/cognition/
meta/reflection/
meta/symbiosis/
meta/meta-process/
meta-architecture/
meta-graph/
```

This layer does not change the physics.
It documents how the understanding formed.

## **Track D — Semantic / API Layer**

Machine-readable structure:

* JSON-LD nodes
* schema definitions
* global index
* semantic interfaces
* API endpoints

Located under:

```
schema/
api/
api/v1/
semantic-search-index.json
```

This enables search engines, LLMs, and external systems to read the project.

# **4. Recommended Reading Order**

For a coherent path:

1. `meta/personal/Personal-Note.md`
2. `meta/README.md`
3. `meta-graph/index.jsonld`
4. `schema/global_schema.json`
5. `meta/symbiosis/README.md`
6. `meta/cognition/README.md`
7. `theory/formal/efc_master.pdf`
8. `output/` (validation figures)
9. `meta-graph/` (structural overview)

This gives you:

1. **who** (context)
2. **how** (process)
3. **what** (theory)
4. **does it hold** (validation)

---

# **5. Why the Repository Contains More Than Theory**

The repository includes:

* scientific models
* validation and data
* meta-architecture
* cognitive and reflective layers
* semantic schemas
* an evolving knowledge graph
* DOI-linked papers and specs

This is intentional.

Because:

* insight stabilizes through externalization
* the reflective process shaped the theory
* future researchers gain total transparency
* semantic layers make the project machine-readable
* validation ensures reproducibility

---

# **6. After This Page**

When you complete this guide:

* read the EFC formal specification
* explore the validation output
* inspect the meta-graph
* examine the semantic schema
* query the API
* explore the notebooks

Everything is open, documented, and reproducible.
