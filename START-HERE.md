# **Start Here — Orientation Guide**

This repository contains three interconnected layers:

1. **EFC (Energy-Flow Cosmology)** — the scientific theory
2. **Validation Layer** — data, figures, comparisons
3. **Meta / Cognition / Symbiosis** — the documented reflective process behind the theory

The purpose of this page is to give you a fast orientation so you can navigate the project correctly from the beginning.

## **1. What EFC Is (Short Overview)**

Energy-Flow Cosmology describes the universe as a thermodynamic flow system.
Cosmic structure, expansion, and observables emerge from:

* energy rate density
* entropy gradients
* local–global flow fields
* s₀–s₁ transitions in light and information

Full formal definition →
**`/theory/formal/efc_master.tex`**
(And generated PDF: `efc_formal_spec.pdf`)

---

## **2. Where to Begin**

Read these first to understand the system, the process, and the person behind it.

### **A. Start with these (3–5 min each)**

* **`personal/Personal-Note.md`**
  Context, cognitive style, and why the process is documented.

* **`meta/README.md`**
  High-level meta-architecture and why the reflective layer exists.

* **`meta-index.json`**
  Machine-readable index of the meta structure.

* **`schema/site-graph.json`**
  The semantic overview of the entire project.

### **B. Then move here**

* **`theory/formal/efc_formal_spec.pdf`** — core theory
* **`output/`** — validation plots, figures, and data

## **3. Three Main Tracks in the Repo**

### **(1) The Theory Track**

All formal models:
EFC-D, EFC-S, entropy fields, potentials, s₀–s₁ light dynamics.

➡ If you want the science → *start here.*

---

### **(2) Validation Track**

SPARC rotation curves, JWST early formation, DESI BAO, lensing, etc.

➡ If you want evidence → *go here.*

---

### **(3) Meta / Cognitive / Symbiosis Track**

How the theory was generated through the interaction between:

* human cognitive field
* model structural engine
* the co-field
* the meta-reflective loop
* the metascope

➡ If you want to understand the process → *this is your path.*

## **4. Recommended Reading Order**

A good path through the project looks like this:

1. `personal/Personal-Note.md`
2. `meta-index.json`
3. `meta/README.md`
4. `symbiosis/README.md`
5. `cognition/README.md`
6. `theory/formal/efc_formal_spec.pdf`
7. `output/` (validation)
8. `meta-graph/` (knowledge graph)

This order gives:

* **who**
* **how**
* **what**
* **does it work?**

---

## **5. Why the Repo Is Structured This Way**

The documentation includes both:

* the scientific theory
* the cognitive and structural process
* the symbiotic mechanism
* the meta-architecture
* all validation data
* semantic graphs and machine-readable layers

This is deliberate:

* insight emerges across s₀–s₁ transitions
* structure stabilises through externalisation
* transparency makes the work inspectable
* future researchers will need *both* the theory and the process
* open science benefits from fully visible reasoning

---

## **6. Next Steps**

Once you finish this page:

* **Read the EFC Master Specification**
* **Explore the validation outputs**
* **Inspect the meta-graph**
* **Run the dashboard** (`meta_dashboard.py`)

Everything is open, documented, and reproducible.
