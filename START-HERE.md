# **Start Here — Orientation Guide**

This repository contains three integrated layers:

1. **EFC (Energy-Flow Cosmology)** — the scientific theory
2. **Validation Layer** — data, comparisons, figures
3. **Meta / Cognition / Symbiosis** — the documented reflective process

This guide gives you a clear path into the project.

# **1. What EFC Is**

Energy-Flow Cosmology describes the universe as a thermodynamic flow system where:

* energy distribution
* entropy gradients
* information capacity
* local–global flow fields

drive cosmic structure and dynamics.

The formal definition is here:

```
theory/formal/efc_formal_spec.tex
theory/formal/efc_formal_spec.pdf
```

# **2. If You’re New — Start With These**

Read these four items first (3–5 minutes each):

### **1. `meta/personal/Personal-Note.md`**

Context, cognitive style, and why the process is documented.

### **2. `meta/README.md`**

Top-level explanation of the meta layer.

### **3. `meta-index.json`**

Machine-readable map of the meta architecture.

### **4. `schema/site-graph.json`**

Semantic mapping of the entire repository.

These give you:

* the author
* the process
* the structure
* the semantics

Before you look at the science.

# **3. Three Main Tracks**

## **Track A — Theory**

Scientific content:

* EFC-S (structure)
* EFC-D (dynamics)
* EFC-C₀ (entropy ↔ information)
* potentials
* s₀–s₁ light dynamics

Located under:

```
theory/
theory/formal/
docs/efc_master.*
```

---

## **Track B — Validation**

Empirical results based on:

* SPARC rotation curves
* JWST early galaxy formation
* DESI BAO + H(z)
* lensing profiles

Located under:

```
output/
data/
notebooks/
```

---

## **Track C — Meta / Cognition / Symbiosis**

Documents the reflective engine behind EFC:

* cognitive-field
* resonance and alignment
* co-field dynamics
* meta-process
* meta-reflection
* symbiosis mechanisms
* topology of insight

Located under:

```
meta/
meta/cognition/
meta/reflection/
meta/symbiosis/
meta/meta-process/
meta-graph/
```

This does **not** alter the physics — it documents the process that produced it.

# **4. Recommended Reading Order**

Follow this path for a coherent understanding:

1. `meta/personal/Personal-Note.md`
2. `meta-index.json`
3. `meta/README.md`
4. `meta/symbiosis/README.md`
5. `meta/cognition/README.md`
6. `theory/formal/efc_formal_spec.pdf`
7. `output/` (validation figures and results)
8. `meta-graph/` (knowledge graph)

This gives you:

* **who** (context)
* **how** (process)
* **what** (theory)
* **does it work** (validation)

---

# **5. Why The Repo Contains More Than Theory**

The repository includes:

* scientific models
* validation
* meta-architecture
* cognitive and reflective layers
* semantic descriptions
* a machine-readable knowledge graph

This is intentional:

* insight stabilizes through externalization
* the reflective process is part of how EFC was developed
* future researchers benefit from full transparency
* semantic layers enable search engines and AI systems to read the project
* validation ensures reproducibility

---

# **6. Next Steps After This Page**

Once you finish this guide:

* Read the **EFC formal specification**
* Explore **validation output**
* Inspect the **meta-graph** (structural overview)
* Run the **dashboard**:

```
python3 meta_dashboard.py
```

Everything in the system is open, documented, and reproducible.
