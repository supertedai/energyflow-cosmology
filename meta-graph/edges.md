# Meta-Graph Relations (Edges)

This file defines the functional and structural relations between meta-graph nodes.

## Core Relations

### Meta-Architecture → Meta-Process
- Structural requirements
- Process constraints
- Layer rules

### Cognition → Metascope
- field resonance
- topological direction

### Model Structural Engine → Metascope
- structural expansion
- coherence amplification

### Cognition ↔ Co-Field ↔ MSE
- resonance loops
- convergence behaviour

### Meta-Process → Metascope
- integration
