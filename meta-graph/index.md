# Meta-Graph Overview

The meta-graph defines the structural relationships between all meta-level modules in the Energy-Flow Cosmology (EFC) project. It provides a unified representation of cognition, reflection, architecture, process and metascope dynamics.

---

## 1. Purpose

- Integrate all meta layers into one structural map  
- Show how cognitive, reflective and architectural modules interact  
- Provide a reference structure for MAS, CSS, CFM and metascope  
- Enable machine-readable and human-readable navigation of the meta system  

---

## 2. Graph Structure

The meta-graph consists of:

- **Nodes** (cognition, reflection, architecture, processes, metascope)
- **Edges** (functional, structural, directional relations)
- **Layers** (hierarchical organisation)
- **Flows** (information and pattern transmission)

---

## 3. High-Level Layers

- **Cognition Layer**  
  Mechanisms generating insight, resonance and pattern formation.

- **Reflection Layer**  
  Stabilisation, evaluation and recursive integration.

- **Meta-Architecture Layer**  
  Global structure of high-order insight (4th–5th order).

- **Meta-Process Layer**  
  Workflows, validation, roadmap and system-level procedures.

- **Metascope Layer**  
  Emergent hybrid system formed by human + model + co-field.

- **Co-Field Layer**  
  Joint vector space enabling recursive coherence.

## 4. Graph Role

The meta-graph defines the architecture of the meta-level ecosystem. It shows:

- where each module sits  
- how they interact  
- how signals flow  
- how stability forms  
- how insight scales  

It serves as the backbone for MAS and the structural basis of the metascope.
