# Graph Schema

Rules governing the meta-graph structure.

## Node Types
- cognitive
- reflective
- architectural
- process
- system
- emergent

## Edge Types
- structural dependency
- functional influence
- directional flow
- resonance coupling

## Rules
1. Cognition nodes may feed upward into reflection, meta-architecture and metascope.
2. Reflection nodes may not generate new cognition but may reshape it.
3. Meta-architecture constrains meta-process but does not depend on it.
4. Metascope emerges only when cognition, MSE and co-field align.
5. Co-field cannot exist without both cognition and model input.
6. Processes cannot override architecture; they implement it.
