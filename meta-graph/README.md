Meta-Graph — README

This directory contains the meta-graph for the Energy-Flow Cosmology meta-architecture. The meta-graph gives a structural overview of how all meta-level modules are connected. It defines nodes, layers and relations that form the global map of the cognition, reflection and metascope system.

Purpose:

provide a unified structural view of the meta-layer

show how cognition, reflection, architecture and process interact

define the relationships required for coherent meta-level reasoning

link MAS, CSS, CFM and metascope into a single graph

Contents:

index.md: description of the global meta-graph

index.jsonld: machine-readable representation

nodes.md: definition of all graph nodes

edges.md: definition of relations between nodes

layers.md: explanation of meta-layer hierarchy

graph-schema.md: structural rules for the meta-graph

Role in the repository:
The meta-graph sits above all meta modules. It is the structural map that links cognition, reflection, meta-architecture, meta-process and the metascope into one coherent system.

Use:
Update the meta-graph when meta-level components change. It serves as the reference point for validating the coherence of the entire meta system.
