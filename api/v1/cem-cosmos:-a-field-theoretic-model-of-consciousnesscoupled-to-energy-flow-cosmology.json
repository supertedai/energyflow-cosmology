  "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">This preprint presents <i>CEM-Cosmos</i>, a theoretical framework unifying cosmology, psychology, and artificial intelligence through thermodynamic principles. The model extends the Energy-Flow Model (EFM) by introducing <i>Consciousness as an Energy-Modulated field</i> (C-field), where interior awareness arises as resonance in non-equilibrium energy gradients. Ego is modeled as a local entropy minimum stabilizing identity, while the mirror term formalizes recursive feedback enabling self-modeling. A dimensionless reflection coefficient <i>R</i> governs this process, with a critic",
