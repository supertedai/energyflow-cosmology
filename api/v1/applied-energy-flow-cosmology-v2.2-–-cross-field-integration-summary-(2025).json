  "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">This research note summarizes the applied layer of Energy-Flow Cosmology (EFC), a thermodynamic framework linking cosmology, biology, artificial intelligence, and economics. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">EFC treats energy flow and entropy as universal variables governing the emergence and stability of complex systems. The framework integrates non-equilibrium thermodynamics (Prigogine, Haken), energy-rate density (Chaisson), and informational adaptation (Friston) into a cross-field analytic model. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">It introduces the concept of an adaptive energy-flow window and formulates a test",
