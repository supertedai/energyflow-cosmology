# Author’s Method Note

The development of Energy-Flow Cosmology followed a reflective, iterative reasoning workflow.

Rather than pursuing a fixed hypothesis, the process evolved through observation of energetic
and informational symmetries that persisted across disciplines.

Each step was assessed through internal resonance and entropic stability — coherence between
conceptual and physical layers was prioritized over formal completion.

The approach values precision of reasoning and open traceability,
reflecting a preference for conceptual transparency before mathematical consolidation.
