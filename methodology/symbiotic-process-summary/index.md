# Symbiotic Process — Summary  
### Operational Overview of the Human–LLM Loop  
**Version 1.0 — M. Magnusson**

---

## 1. Purpose
This summary provides a compact description of how the human and the LLM operate together in the EFC workflow.  
It distills the core logic of the symbiotic loop into short steps for quick reference and integration.

---

## 2. Core Logic
The symbiotic process is built on three principles:

1. **Human defines direction**  
   Goals, meaning, interpretation, and scientific decisions originate from the human.

2. **LLM structures the process**  
   The LLM organizes, validates, and reformats information without altering scientific intent.

3. **Short iterative cycles**  
   Each reasoning step is refined through explicit, repeatable sequences.

## 3. The Symbiotic Loop (Short Version)

### Step 1 — Human Intent  
Human provides:
- task  
- constraint  
- correction  
- revision  
- theoretical direction  

### Step 2 — LLM Structuring  
LLM returns:
- structured representation  
- corrected logic  
- improved clarity  
- semantic extraction  
- consistent formatting  

### Step 3 — Human Validation  
Human:
- checks meaning  
- adjusts direction  
- approves or rejects the output  

### Step 4 — LLM Consolidation  
LLM:
- produces final structured text  
- updates schema or documentation  
- ensures consistency with previous layers  

This completes one cycle.

## 4. Role Separation (Short)

### Human  
- epistemic decisions  
- interpretation  
- conceptual innovation  
- revision control  

### LLM  
- structure  
- clarity  
- consistency  
- semantic alignment  
- code generation

## 5. Rules for Stability

- all assumptions must be explicit  
- no hidden inference  
- LLM does not generate physical assumptions  
- human validates every iteration  
- all transformations must be reproducible  
- semantic mappings must remain consistent across versions  

---

## 6. Integration
The summary connects to:
- Symbiosis Interface  
- Symbiotic Process (LLM)  
- Open-Method  
- Open-Process  

It acts as a quick reference for controlling the reasoning loop.

---

## 7. Outcome
The summary keeps the human–LLM collaboration:
- stable  
- aligned  
- predictable  
- traceable  

It ensures that high-complexity reasoning remains anchored in human intention and formally structured in the EFC system.
