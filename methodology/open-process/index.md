# Open-Process  
### Transparent Scientific Process for Energy-Flow Cosmology  
**Version 1.0 — M. Magnusson**

---

## 1. Purpose
Open-Process defines how the scientific workflow in Energy-Flow Cosmology (EFC) is structured, executed, and documented.  
It ensures that each step of the research process can be inspected, verified, and reproduced by any external reader.

Open-Process connects:
- inputs  
- transformations  
- outputs  
- updates  
- revisions  

into a coherent, traceable workflow.

## 2. Process Structure

### 2.1 Input Phase
The following inputs initiate a research cycle:
- observational data  
- theoretical primitives (ρ, S, Ef)  
- existing EFC equations  
- methodological constraints  
- revision notes from previous cycles  

All inputs must be explicitly stated and logged.

---

### 2.2 Transformation Phase
This phase applies the core reasoning steps:
- derive functional relationships  
- update entropy or energy-flow fields  
- re-evaluate assumptions  
- compute predictions (curves, profiles, gradients)  

Transformations must be minimal and directly tied to domain logic.

---

### 2.3 Validation Phase
All outputs are compared to:
- rotation curve profiles  
- entropy distributions  
- lensing signatures  
- structural scaling relations  
- thermodynamic consistency  

A validation result is only accepted if it strengthens internal coherence and empirical fit.

---

### 2.4 Decision Phase
A decision is made based on validation:

**Accept** if:  
1. predictions follow from ρ–S–Ef,  
2. no speculative additions are required,  
3. the result matches observational trends.

**Reject** if:  
- contradictions appear,  
- assumptions become unstable,  
- a more consistent derivation exists.

---

### 2.5 Revision Phase
Revisions occur only when evidence demands it.  
A revision must:
- reduce ambiguity  
- improve clarity  
- increase empirical alignment  
- maintain thermodynamic consistency  

All revisions are documented in short, explicit steps.

---

## 3. Logging Rules
Each process cycle must log:
- what changed  
- why it changed  
- which inputs triggered it  
- which EFC layers were affected  
- version increments  

Logging is minimal but complete.

---

## 4. Integration With Tools

Open-Process is supported by:
- semantic extract workflows  
- JSON-LD indexing  
- validation scripts  
- EFC simulators  
- rotation/lensing comparison utilities  

External tools assist only with structure and clarity.  
Scientific decisions remain human-driven.

---

## 5. Outcome
Open-Process guarantees:
- transparency in reasoning  
- reproducibility of results  
- clear model evolution  
- stable long-term structure  

It defines *how* EFC progresses, step by step, without hidden inference or opaque updates.
