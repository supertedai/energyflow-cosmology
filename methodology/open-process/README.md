# Open-Process

This directory defines the Open-Process framework for Energy-Flow Cosmology (EFC).

Open-Process formalizes how research steps are executed, validated, revised, and logged.
It ensures that the development of EFC remains transparent, reproducible, and externally verifiable.

- `index.md` — full Open-Process specification
- `index.jsonld` — semantic JSON-LD description node
