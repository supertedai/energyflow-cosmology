# Symbiosis Interface and Reflective Collaboration  
Energy-Flow Cosmology (EFC)  
Last updated: 2025-11-14

## 1. Purpose  
The symbiosis interface defines how human reasoning and AI structural assistance interact as part of the EFC methodology.  
This file now links explicitly to the full symbiotic process documentation.

---

## 2. Relation to Other Documents  
- `symbiotic-process.md` – full methodological description  
- `symbiotic-process-llm.md` – operational specification for LLM behavior  
- `symbiotic-process-summary.md` – short overview  
- `open-process.json` – machine-readable mapping  
- `open-method.md` – general methodological principles

## 3. Interface Functions

### 3.1 Dialogic Reflection  
Used to refine reasoning before code or documentation updates.

### 3.2 Versioned Reasoning  
Dialogue contributes to the evolving state across commits, schema, and notes.

### 3.3 Feedback Mechanism  
The interface follows a loop:

dialogue → structure → workflow → validation → revision

### 3.4 Semantic Integration  
Outputs feed into:

- JSON-LD definitions  
- Neo4j nodes  
- Figshare metadata  
- documentation

## 4. Roles and Boundaries  
Human: theory, assumptions, scientific direction  
AI: structural clarity, consistency, interpretation of workflow signals  

AI does not originate theory or conclusions.

---

## 5. Research Value  
The interface functions as a transparent and reproducible layer for reasoning and structural development.

---

## 6. Summary  
The symbiosis interface connects reflective dialogue with structured scientific development and links directly to the symbiotic process documentation.
