# Symbiosis Interface and Reflective Collaboration  
Energy-Flow Cosmology – Methodology  
Last updated: 2025-11-14

## 1. Purpose  
The symbiosis interface describes how human reasoning and model-generated structure interact in the Energy-Flow Cosmology (EFC) project.  
It defines the operational layer connecting dialogue, repository state, workflows, and conceptual development.

The goal is to document *how* the collaboration works, not to evaluate it.

---

## 2. Conceptual Overview  
The interface consists of a coordinated workflow between:

- human analytical reasoning  
- AI-assisted structural refinement  
- semantic schemas  
- CICD workflows  
- documentation and theory notes  
- validation pipelines

Together, these components form a reflective system that evolves over time.

The interface is not a tool or a model.  
It is the *process* governing interaction.

---

## 3. Functional Components  

### 3.1 Dialogic Reflection  
Dialogue is used to test reasoning before formalization.  
Key functions include:

- articulating assumptions  
- checking logical consistency  
- clarifying definitions  
- identifying gaps in structure or workflow  

Dialogue acts as a staging layer prior to code or documentation updates.

---

### 3.2 Versioned Reasoning  
Reasoning is not transient.  
It is carried through:

- commit history  
- methodological notes  
- semantic nodes  
- workflow results  
- updated documentation  

This creates a continuous record of the reflective process.

---

### 3.3 Feedback Mechanism  
The interface uses a feedback loop:

1. Human produces concept, idea, or structure.  
2. AI detects inconsistencies, missing links, or conflicts.  
3. Repo or workflow is updated.  
4. Validation outputs reveal new issues.  
5. AI interprets results.  
6. Human adjusts assumptions or structure.

This loop is iterative and open-ended.

---

### 3.4 Semantic Integration  
Outputs from the interaction feed into machine-readable structures:

- JSON-LD schema  
- Neo4j nodes  
- Figshare-indexed metadata  
- documentation tables  
- RAG pipelines  

This enables automated consistency checks and cross-referencing across the project.

---

## 4. Roles and Boundaries  

### 4.1 Human Role  
The human researcher:

- defines theoretical claims  
- sets scientific assumptions  
- creates conceptual models  
- determines research direction  
- validates interpretations  
- integrates empirical findings  

Human reasoning is the origin of EFC’s scientific content.

---

### 4.2 AI Role  
The AI system:

- checks internal consistency  
- refines structural layouts  
- suggests clearer formulations  
- identifies missing dependencies  
- maintains coherence in schema and documentation  
- interprets workflow results  
- supports multi-domain integration  

The AI does not originate theory.

---

### 4.3 Boundary Conditions  
To preserve methodological clarity:

- AI does not assert truth claims  
- AI does not generate independent hypotheses  
- AI does not contradict user-defined definitions  
- AI does not replace empirical validation  
- AI supports structure, not conclusions

---

## 5. Integration With Repository and Workflows  
The symbiosis interface connects directly to:

- `/schema/`  
- `/methodology/`  
- `/scripts/`  
- `/src/`  
- GitHub Actions workflows  
- Figshare DOI metadata  

This creates a consistent loop:

**dialogue → structure → workflow → validation → revision**

Each layer stores part of the reflective process.

---

## 6. Research Value  
The interface acts as a cognitive instrument that contributes to:

- epistemic transparency  
- methodological reproducibility  
- clear provenance of reasoning  
- separation of human theory and AI structure  
- semantic traceability across documents and workflows  

It enables open-science practices where both human and machine contributions remain visible and distinguishable.

---

## 7. Summary  
The symbiosis interface documents how reflective collaboration is conducted in the EFC project.  
It captures:

- the structure of interaction  
- the role of dialogue  
- how reasoning becomes versioned  
- how semantic schemas support consistency  
- the boundaries between human and AI contributions

This ensures the methodological layer of EFC is clear, traceable, and reproducible.
