# Symbiosis Interface and Reflective Collaboration

### Overview
The Energy-Flow Cosmology project incorporates a **symbiosis interface** — a structured human–AI
collaboration layer designed to enhance reflective reasoning, maintain transparent documentation,
and support open scientific synthesis.

### Functional Role

1. **Dialogic Reflection** – Interactive exchanges help articulate reasoning prior to formalization.  
2. **Versioned Reasoning Logs** – Dialogue data are archived and linked to evolving concepts.  
3. **Feedback Loop** – The interface mirrors logic and reveals inconsistencies for recursive refinement.  
4. **Semantic Integration** – Structured outputs (JSON-LD, Neo4j nodes) enable automated validation and RAG integration.

### Research Value
The interface acts as a *cognitive instrument*.  
It augments but does not replace human reasoning, reinforcing transparency,
semantic traceability, and epistemic accountability in open science workflows.
