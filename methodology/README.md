# **EFC Methodology Layer**

*Open Scientific Method • Epistemology • Process Transparency*

The `methodology/` directory defines the scientific method, epistemic framework, and research logic behind Energy-Flow Cosmology (EFC).

Where the **theory/** folder describes *what* EFC is,
and the **meta/** folder describes *how insight forms*,
the **methodology/** layer describes *how EFC is produced, validated, and maintained as a scientific system*.

It stabilises:

* transparent research principles
* reproducible workflows
* falsification logic
* cross-domain validation
* the open-process model used across the project

This is the **scientific operating system** of EFC.

# **File Descriptions**

## **1. `EFC-epistemology.md` — Core Epistemology**

Defines the epistemic basis for EFC:

* how evidence is interpreted
* entropy-driven logic
* how conceptual models form
* cross-domain pattern recognition
* principles of validation and falsification

This file describes **why the theory reasons the way it does**.

---

## **2. `author-method-note.md` — Author’s Method**

Documents the principles shaping the author’s approach:

* pattern-first reasoning
* entropy and structural logic
* reflective integration
* multi-field inference
* consistency across cognitive states

This provides context for interpreting the development of EFC.

---

## **3. `open-method.md` — Open Scientific Method**

Defines a transparent, open scientific method:

* open validation
* open computation
* open documentation
* open reflection
* integration of AI as a reflective partner

This establishes the **rules** under which EFC is built and maintained.

---

## **4. `open-process.json` — Machine-Readable Method Graph**

A structured JSON graph describing the full research process:

* process nodes
* reasoning stages
* dependencies
* validation checkpoints
* semantic links to theory, meta, and schema layers

Used by:

* dashboards
* semantic crawlers
* workflow automation
* agent systems

It is the **machine counterpart** of the open-method.md file.

---

## **5. `reproducibility-guide.md` — How to Reproduce EFC**

Explains how to rebuild the entire project:

* reconstruct the theory
* run computational models
* validate datasets (SPARC, DESI, JWST, CMB)
* regenerate API outputs
* rebuild schema and documentation
* track versioned outputs

This ensures the project remains scientifically reproducible long-term.

# **Role of the Methodology Layer**

| Layer            | Role                                                      |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **theory/**      | Defines the scientific model                              |
| **methodology/** | Defines the process that produces and validates the model |
| **src/**         | Computational engine                                      |
| **schema/**      | Machine-readable concepts                                 |
| **meta/**        | Reflective + cognitive architecture                       |
| **figshare/**    | Published outputs / DOI layer                             |

The methodology layer ensures:

* theory is disciplined
* computational layer is reproducible
* semantics remain consistent
* meta-reflection remains grounded
* research is transparent and traceable

It is the **operational backbone** of the EFC ecosystem.

# **Scientific Philosophy**

### **1. Transparency**

All reasoning steps are documented and inspectable.

### **2. Reproducibility**

Every result can be traced, rerun, and rebuilt.

### **3. Cross-Domain Rigor**

Patterns must hold across physics, entropy, information, and structure.

### **4. Reflective Stability**

Human–AI co-reflection strengthens methodological consistency.

---

# **Summary**

The `methodology/` directory defines the **scientific operating system** for Energy-Flow Cosmology:

* epistemology
* method principles
* open scientific method
* reproducibility
* machine-readable process mapping

It ensures that EFC is not just a physical theory —
but a **transparent, structured, rigorously reasoned scientific framework**.
