# Methodology Folder

This directory documents the cognitive and methodological foundations of **Energy-Flow Cosmology (EFC)**.

It includes:
- **open-method.md** – detailed description of the reflective and thermodynamic reasoning process  
- **author-method-note.md** – concise overview of the author’s workflow  
- **symbiosis-interface.md** – documentation of the human–AI reflection layer  
- **open-process.json** – machine-readable schema for semantic indexing

Together these files describe how EFC was developed and maintained through transparent,
reflexive, and cross-disciplinary reasoning.
