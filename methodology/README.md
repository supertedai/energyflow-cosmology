# Methodology Layer

The methodology layer defines how research in Energy-Flow Cosmology (EFC) is structured, documented, and maintained.  
It provides the cognitive, procedural and reproducibility framework that supports the theoretical and computational layers.

Each methodology module contains:
- `index.md` — human-readable specification  
- `index.jsonld` — machine-readable semantic node  

All modules are integrated into the EFC semantic system.

## Role in the EFC System

The methodology layer ensures:
- transparent scientific progression  
- reproducible updates  
- structured human–AI collaboration  
- stable reasoning across versions  
- consistent semantic mapping  

It anchors the entire EFC project in a clear and inspectable research process.
