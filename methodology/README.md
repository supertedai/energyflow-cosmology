# Methodology

This folder defines the methodological foundations of the Energy-Flow Cosmology project.  
The goal is to document how knowledge is created, structured, validated and maintained across time.

The methodology consists of several layers:

- **AI-Augmented Scientific Workflow Framework** — how AI assists structure, not conclusions.
- **EFC Epistemology** — how the project defines evidence, inference and theory boundaries.
- **Author Method Note** — author-level reflections on reasoning, structure and process.
- **Core Methodology** — the stable, reusable method for theory development.
- **Open Method** — how the method is openly documented and versioned.
- **Open Process** — stepwise process transparency and public traceability.
- **Reproducibility Guide** — instructions for reproducing results and computations.
- **Symbiosis Interface** — human–AI interaction model inside the research workflow.
- **Symbiotic Process** — the multi-layer reasoning loop.
- **Symbiotic Process Summary** — simplified overview of the reflective process.
- **Symbiotic Process LLM** — the interface layer for large language models.

Each subfolder contains:
- a `README.md` (human-readable description)
- an `index.md` (full document)
- an `index.jsonld` (machine-readable metadata)
