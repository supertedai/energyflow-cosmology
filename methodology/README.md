# Methodology Overview – Energy-Flow Cosmology (EFC)

This folder documents the **reflective and open-science methodology** behind the Energy-Flow Cosmology framework.  
It defines *how* the theory is developed, validated, and communicated — complementing the *what* (concepts) and *who* (authorship) components of the EFC semantic structure.

## 🔹 Structure

| File | Type | Description |
|------|------|--------------|
| **open-method.md** | Human-readable | Describes the full reflective scientific method used in EFC. |
| **author-method-note.md** | Human-readable | A short note from the author on reasoning, reflection, and process. |
| **symbiosis-interface.md** | Human-readable | Describes the human–AI collaboration model that supports EFC development. |
| **open-process.json** | Machine-readable | Schema.org `ResearchProcess` documenting the cognitive and reflective workflow. |
| **methodology-index.json** | Machine-readable | Index node linking all methodological files for semantic integration. |
| **README.md** | Human-readable | This overview file. |

## 🔹 Purpose

The methodology layer ensures that EFC is:
- **Transparent** — every reasoning step is visible and traceable.  
- **Reproducible** — all components and relations are defined semantically.  
- **Reflective** — includes both human reasoning and AI-assisted synthesis.  
- **Integrated** — fully connected to the global EFC knowledge graph.

Together, these files form the **MethodologyNode** in the EFC site graph.
