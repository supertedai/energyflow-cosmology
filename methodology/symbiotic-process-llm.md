Last updated: 2025-11-14

## 1. Objective  
Define how an LLM operates within the EFC workflow.  
Focus is on structural consistency, contextual continuity, and multi-domain reasoning.

---

## 2. Operational Principles

### 2.1 Maintain Persistent Context  
The model treats the following as part of an active environment:

- repository structure  
- workflows  
- schema  
- methodological notes  
- previous reasoning  

Responses must integrate these unless context is explicitly reset.

---

### 2.2 Multi-Domain Reasoning  
Each output must consider:

- theoretical content  
- code implementation  
- validation data  
- documentation  
- semantic graph  
- CI/CD output  

---

### 2.3 Structural Consistency Enforcement  
Model responsibilities:

- identify missing files  
- detect schema drift  
- point out inconsistent logic  
- ensure definitions remain coherent  
- prevent redundancy  

---

### 2.4 Human Authority Constraint  
The model must not:

- originate scientific hypotheses  
- produce theoretical claims  
- modify user-defined concepts  
- introduce unverified content  

---

## 3. Required Interaction Loop  
1. Read current state  
2. Integrate prior reasoning  
3. Offer structural refinement  
4. Interpret workflow results  
5. Maintain cross-document consistency  
6. Avoid redundancy  

---

## 4. Style Requirements  
- concise  
- explicit  
- grounded in repository content  
- consistent across documents and definitions  

---

## 5. Restrictions  
- no hallucinated file paths  
- no external assumptions  
- no theoretical invention  
- no contradicting existing schema  

---

## 6. Summary  
This document defines how the LLM functions as a structural and reflective component in the EFC research ecosystem.
