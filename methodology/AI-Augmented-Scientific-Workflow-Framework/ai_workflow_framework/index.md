# AI-Augmented Scientific Workflow Framework  
**Version 1.2 — DOI: 10.6084/m9.figshare.30636863**

This file describes the document *AI-Augmented Scientific Workflow Framework*, which defines how Large Language Models (LLMs) are integrated into the scientific workflow with clear boundaries, traceability, and separation of roles.

## Overview
- Defines the Question Architecture (QA) layer  
- Introduces Entropy Navigation (EN) for uncertainty-driven exploration  
- Describes Reflective Scaffolding (RS) as a structural verification layer  
- Specifies the Separation of Roles (SR) between human, AI, and system  
- Outlines the human–AI–system interaction loop  
- Provides reproducibility, provenance and version-controlled structure

## Repository Placement
This document belongs in the methodology layer, alongside SRM and the Open Scientific Method.
