# AI-Augmented Scientific Workflow Framework

## Overview
The framework defines the architecture for an AI-supported research environment.
The primary purpose is to enhance stability, structure and traceability.

## Principles
- Human reasoning drives all scientific conclusions.
- AI contributes structure, formatting, metadata and consistency.
- All AI-generated material is reviewable and replaceable.
- Insight loops are documented without affecting theoretical content.

## Components
- Data ingestion
- Schema generation
- Versioning and provenance
- Documentation and index layers
- Semantic links across the repository

## Output
This framework provides predictable structure for:
- papers  
- schemas  
- metadata  
- cross-references  
- validation pipelines
