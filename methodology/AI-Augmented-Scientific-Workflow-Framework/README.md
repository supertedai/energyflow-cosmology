# AI-Augmented Scientific Workflow Framework

This folder describes the structured workflow where AI assists with organisation, routing,
consistency, metadata and documentation — but never influences scientific conclusions.

It defines:
- separation between insight and structure
- flow of information between human and system
- stable schema for research assets
- the boundary conditions ensuring scientific independence
