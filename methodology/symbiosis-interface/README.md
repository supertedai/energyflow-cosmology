# Symbiosis Interface

This directory defines the Symbiosis Interface for the Energy-Flow Cosmology (EFC) project.

The interface describes how a human researcher and an AI system collaborate,
how responsibilities are separated, and how co-reasoning remains transparent,
reproducible, and scientifically grounded.

Files:
- `index.md` — full Symbiosis Interface specification
- `index.jsonld` — semantic JSON-LD node
