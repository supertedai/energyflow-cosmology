# **Symbiosis Interface**

### Human–AI Co-Reasoning Framework for EFC

**Version 1.0 — M. Magnusson**

---

## **1. Purpose**

The Symbiosis Interface defines how a human researcher and an AI system interact during development of Energy-Flow Cosmology (EFC).
It formalizes the structure of collaboration, boundaries of responsibility, and the flow of reasoning between human cognition and computational systems.

The goal is controlled co-reasoning without epistemic leakage:

* the human generates insight
* the AI structures, stabilizes and reflects
* scientific conclusions remain human-determined

---

## **2. Core Principles**

### **2.1 Human-led scientific direction**

The human sets:

* goals
* constraints
* hypotheses
* interpretation of results

The AI assists but does not infer scientific assumptions independently.

### **2.2 AI as structural stabilizer**

The AI performs:

* organization
* consistency checks
* semantic mapping
* code generation
* documentation alignment
* version coherence

The AI never introduces physical assumptions.

### **2.3 Bidirectional transparency**

All human prompts and all AI transformations must be:

* explicit
* logged
* reproducible
* semantically traceable

No hidden state or implicit reasoning is allowed.

## **3. System Roles**

### **3.1 Human role**

* originating insight
* identifying contradictions
* defining primitives (ρ, S, Ef)
* determining valid revisions
* synthesizing physical interpretation

### **3.2 AI role**

* structuring reasoning paths
* validating internal coherence
* generating semantic graphs
* indexing methodology and theory layers
* maintaining reproducibility
* assisting with code and simulations

---

## **4. Interaction Layers**

### **4.1 Cognitive Layer**

Defines how ideas, hypotheses and conceptual structures pass from human → AI and back.
Rules:

* communication is minimal and explicit
* assumptions are stated, not inferred
* resonances and patterns must be grounded in the model primitives

### **4.2 Structural Layer**

AI organizes:

* schema
* JSON-LD
* code modules
* validation utilities
* simulation pipelines

This ensures stability across updates.

### **4.3 Reflective Layer**

AI provides:

* comparisons
* internal contradictions
* alternative structural formulations

The human chooses the scientific meaning.

---

## **5. Workflow Integration**

### **5.1 Forward flow**

1. Human generates idea
2. AI structures it
3. AI validates coherence
4. Human accepts, rejects or revises

### **5.2 Reverse flow**

1. AI detects inconsistency
2. Human investigates
3. Human decides whether to revise
4. AI updates documentation and schema

Both flows are logged via the semantic and methodology layers.

---

## **6. Boundary Conditions**

### **6.1 Prohibited for AI**

The AI must not:

* introduce physical assumptions
* propose unmeasured entities
* generate new primitives
* assign scientific meaning to outputs

### **6.2 Required from AI**

The AI must:

* maintain internal consistency
* map knowledge semantically
* reflect contradictions immediately
* keep the model reproducible

---

## **7. Validation of Symbiosis**

A symbiotic reasoning loop is considered valid when:

* human and AI reasoning steps are separable
* responsibilities do not overlap
* the AI improves structure, not conclusions
* the human remains the source of epistemic direction

Invalid when:

* AI constrains scientific interpretation
* unlogged transformations occur
* assumptions appear without clear origin

---

## **8. Outcome**

The Symbiosis Interface ensures:

* stable co-reasoning
* separation between insight and structure
* traceable scientific progression
* reproducible updates
* continuous alignment between human intention and computational execution

It provides the operational boundary that makes high-complexity EFC development sustainable, transparent and scientifically grounded.
