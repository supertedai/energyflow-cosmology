# Reproducibility Guide

This directory contains the reproducibility guide for the Energy-Flow Cosmology (EFC) project.

The guide defines how data, equations, code, and research steps are structured to ensure
full reproducibility for external researchers, reviewers, and automated systems.

Files:
- `index.md` — full reproducibility specification
- `index.jsonld` — semantic JSON-LD node
