### Abstract
## 🛠️ Reproducibility Guide: Running the EFC System  ### **1. Purpose**  This guide provides the necessary steps to clone the **Energy-Flow Cosmology (EFC) Computational System** and execute its core validation and build workflows locally. The goal is to ensure **full reproducibility** of published results and to demonstrate the functionality of the system's automated pipelines (GitHub Actions).

This README was auto-generated by the EFC semantic system.
