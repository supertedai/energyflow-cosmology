# EFC Epistemology

## Purpose
To formalise the epistemic foundation of the Energy-Flow framework.

## Structure
- Types of evidence (observational, statistical, structural)
- Inference methods
- Limits of extrapolation
- Theory–data interactions
- Interpretation principles

## Output
A stable map of how EFC treats:
- what counts as evidence  
- how hypotheses are evaluated  
- how theory integrates new information
