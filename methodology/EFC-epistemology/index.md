# EFC Epistemology  
### Foundational Principles for a Thermodynamic Cosmology  
**Version 1.0 — Author: M. Magnusson**

---

## 1. Purpose
This document defines the epistemic foundations of Energy-Flow Cosmology (EFC).  
It specifies how knowledge is established, validated and constrained within a thermodynamic cosmological model.

---

## 2. Epistemic Position
EFC adopts a non-axiomatic, thermodynamic epistemology:

1. The universe is treated as a physical information system.  
2. No invisible entities are introduced unless empirically required.  
3. All equations are derived from measurable quantities.  
4. Explanatory sufficiency outweighs mathematical minimalism.

---

## 3. First-Principles Basis
EFC is built from three primitives:

- **Energy distribution** \( \rho(r) \)  
- **Entropy field** \( S(r) \)  
- **Energy-flow potential** \( E_f(r) = \rho(1 - S) \)

All higher-level behaviour emerges from these fields.

---

## 4. Method of Derivation
EFC uses a constructive method:

1. Start from minimal physical fields.  
2. Define functional relations from thermodynamic reasoning.  
3. Derive predictions.  
4. Compare to data.  
5. Revise only when observation requires it.

---

## 5. Observational Constraints
Accepted evidence:

- direct measurements  
- statistical structure  
- information-level constraints  

---

## 6. Model Validation Logic
A prediction is valid when:

- it follows directly from \( \rho, S, E_f \)  
- it matches data without exotic components  
- deviations can be tied to measurable inputs  

A prediction is rejected when it requires speculative fields.

## 7. Scope and Limits

### EFC explains:
- rotation curves  
- halo structure  
- lensing profiles  
- early galaxy formation  
- entropy-dependent propagation  
- thermodynamic interpretation of CMB features  

### EFC does not assume:
- dark matter particles  
- dark energy fields  
- postulated modified gravity  

---

## 8. Epistemic Guarantees
EFC guarantees:

- traceability  
- internal coherence  
- falsifiability  
- scalability  

---

## 9. Conclusion
EFC’s epistemology provides a stable, data-driven basis for a thermodynamic cosmology grounded in measurable fields and consistent validation.
