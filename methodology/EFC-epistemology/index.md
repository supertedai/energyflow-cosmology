# EFC Epistemology
Energy-Flow Cosmology is built from first principles. This document explains the basis for knowledge in the model, how reasoning works, and how we evaluate whether the framework holds.

## 1. Foundations of Knowledge
EFC starts from measurable quantities:
- energy  
- entropy  
- gradients  
- local geometry  
- temporal change  

Everything is constructed from these five.

Principle:
- Do not assume entities that cannot be linked to measurable fields.  
- Describe gravity, structure, and time through energy flow and entropy change.

## 2. Logical Chain (first principles → cosmology)
1. Energy flows from higher to lower potential.  
2. Entropy follows changes in energy flow.  
3. Gradients generate structure.  
4. Structure feeds back into the flow field.  
5. The resulting dynamics produce cosmic expansion, halo structure, and velocity fields.

This replaces assumptions about dark matter and dark energy.

## 3. How EFC Evaluates Whether the Model Is Correct
Three scales of evidence:
- **local:** rotation curves, halo profiles, entropy density  
- **intermediate:** grouping, filaments, mass inflow  
- **cosmic:** expansion rate, structure growth, background signals  

The same set of rules must explain all scales.

## 4. Testability
EFC is evaluated by:
- how directly the model connects to observational data  
- whether the equations reproduce patterns without extra parameters  
- whether results remain consistent across scales  

Tests are implemented in:
`/scripts/validate_efc.py` and `/notebooks/`.

## 5. Error Correction
EFC adjusts when:
- energy flow does not match data  
- entropy profiles mismatch observed structure  
- expansion deviates from predicted flow  

Corrections are applied to core functions, not by adding free parameters.

## 6. Why This Epistemology Works
In short:
- energy is measurable  
- entropy is measurable  
- models built on measurable fields remain transparent  
- models without free parameters gain explanatory strength  

---

## 7. How This Epistemology Differs From ΛCDM
ΛCDM:
- relies on two unobserved components  
- requires several free parameters to match data  

EFC:
- models dynamics directly from physical fields  
- avoids unobserved components  
- uses thermodynamics rather than particle assumptions  

---

## 8. Implicit Requirement: Full Reproducibility
The EFC epistemology requires:
- complete transparency in computation  
- full version control  
- clear data provenance  
- full mathematical specification (`efc_formal_spec.tex`)  

When data, theory, and code align, the model becomes reproducible.

## 9. Core Logic (essence)
1. Everything begins with energy.  
2. Change produces entropy.  
3. Gradients produce structure.  
4. Structure shapes dynamics.  
5. Dynamics produce observations.  
6. Test across all scales.  
7. Revise only when data forces it.  

This is the EFC knowledge pathway.
