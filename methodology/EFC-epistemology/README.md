# EFC Epistemology

This directory contains the epistemic foundation of Energy-Flow Cosmology (EFC).  
It defines how knowledge is constructed, validated and constrained inside the thermodynamic EFC framework.

Files:

- `index.md` — full epistemology document
- `index.jsonld` — semantic JSON-LD for knowledge graphs and search engines

This module is part of the EFC methodology layer.
