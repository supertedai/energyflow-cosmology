# Author’s Method Note  
### Version 1.0 — M. Magnusson

---

## 1. Purpose
This note explains how the author approaches model-building, validation, and revision within the EFC framework.  
It documents the methodological discipline used to ensure clarity, reproducibility, and traceability.

---

## 2. Working Principles

### 2.1 Start from measurable fields
All reasoning begins with measurable or physically inferable quantities:  
- density  
- entropy  
- energy flow  
- information capacity  

No speculative entities are introduced.

### 2.2 Build upward from first principles
Models are constructed by deriving consequences from the interaction between ρ, S, and \(E_f\).  
Assumptions must be explicitly stated and minimal.

### 2.3 Prioritize structure over narrative
Concepts, fields, and relations are formalized before verbal explanations.  
The goal is internal coherence, not storytelling.

## 3. Decision Logic

### 3.1 Model acceptance
A model component is accepted when:
1. it follows from defined primitives  
2. it is mathematically consistent  
3. it connects to measurable quantities  
4. it improves explanatory coverage without adding speculative terms  

### 3.2 Model rejection
A component is rejected when:
- it requires unobservable entities  
- it increases complexity without resolving open questions  
- it breaks coherence with the thermodynamic foundation  

---

## 4. Handling Uncertainty
Uncertainty is treated as structural, not narrative.  
When data is incomplete, the model remains incomplete.  
No placeholders or hypothetical fields are introduced.

---

## 5. Revision Policy
A revision is performed only when:
- new data imposes constraints  
- a contradiction appears within the theoretical layer  
- a more consistent formulation exists that preserves empirical fit  

Revisions must reduce ambiguity and increase structural clarity.

---

## 6. Interaction With AI Systems
AI is used for:
- structural organization  
- semantic extraction  
- validation of logical coherence  
- code generation  
- documentation consistency  

AI is not used for:
- proposing physical assumptions  
- deciding model conclusions  

All scientific decisions remain human-driven.

## 7. Conclusion
This method ensures that EFC remains grounded, coherent, and traceable.  
The purpose is stability in reasoning and clarity in the progression of the theory.
