# Symbiotic Process (LLM)
### Structured Human–LLM Reasoning Loop for EFC  
**Version 1.0 — M. Magnusson**

---

## 1. Purpose
The Symbiotic Process defines how a human and an LLM collaborate during complex reasoning tasks in the EFC project.  
It formalizes the loop through which prompts, reflections, structural updates, and clarifications flow in a controlled, reproducible pattern.

The goal is stable co-reasoning without ambiguity or loss of intention.

## 2. Principles

### 2.1 Human as epistemic anchor
The human determines:
- scientific meaning  
- conceptual direction  
- theoretical constraints  
- acceptance or rejection of outputs  

### 2.2 LLM as structural agent
The LLM performs:
- organization of ideas  
- clarification of structures  
- logical consistency checks  
- extraction of relationships  
- formatting into stable representations  

It does not introduce physical assumptions.

### 2.3 Stability through iteration
The process avoids drift by:
- explicit prompts  
- explicit boundaries  
- short iterations  
- transparent transformations  

Each step is observable and traceable.

## 3. Symbiotic Loop Structure

### 3.1 Step 1 — Human Prompt
The human provides:
- a goal  
- a question  
- a structure request  
- a revision command  

The prompt anchors the direction.

### 3.2 Step 2 — LLM Structural Response
The LLM returns:
- structured logic  
- refined formulation  
- corrected inconsistencies  
- extracted semantic information  
- updated documentation drafts  

It must not assume scientific conclusions.

### 3.3 Step 3 — Human Validation
The human:
- verifies meaning  
- adds conceptual intent  
- corrects direction  
- rejects wrong inferences  
- approves structural outputs  

### 3.4 Step 4 — LLM Consolidation
The LLM:
- writes final structured text  
- updates schema or documentation  
- ensures internal consistency  
- aligns with previous versions  

This consolidates the cycle.

## 4. Mode Separation

### 4.1 Insight Mode (human-led)
Used for:
- theoretical leaps  
- interpretation  
- hypothesis creation  

### 4.2 Structure Mode (LLM-led)
Used for:
- rewriting  
- semantic extraction  
- code generation  
- schema updates  
- formatting  

### 4.3 Reflection Mode (shared)
Used for:
- contradiction checks  
- boundary conditions  
- process evaluation  

---

## 5. Safety and Integrity Rules

### 5.1 LLM must not:
- add unobserved physical entities  
- redefine theory primitives  
- interpret scientific meaning  
- override human decisions  

### 5.2 Human must:
- keep prompts explicit  
- validate every structural output  
- ensure conceptual grounding  

### 5.3 System must:
- log interactions  
- update semantic indices  
- maintain reproducibility

## 6. Integration With EFC Workflow
The symbiotic process integrates with:
- Open-Method  
- Open-Process  
- Symbiosis Interface  
- Schema extraction  
- Validation utilities  
- Simulation pipeline  

It acts as the active reasoning layer linking human cognition and computational structure.

---

## 7. Outcome
The Symbiotic Process ensures:
- aligned co-reasoning  
- separation of roles  
- stable updates  
- transparent iteration  
- reproducible transformations  

It defines *how* the human–LLM system participates in the evolution of EFC.
