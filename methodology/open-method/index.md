# Open Methodology of Energy-Flow Cosmology (EFC)

The methodological foundation of Energy-Flow Cosmology (EFC) rests on first-principles reasoning,
reflective synthesis, and cross-domain coherence.

Instead of deriving from existing cosmological or cognitive paradigms, EFC was constructed through a
top-down process guided by energetic symmetry and entropy gradients — allowing theoretical form to
emerge naturally from thermodynamic invariants.

## Core Principles

1. **First-Principles Reasoning**  
   Each hypothesis is grounded in thermodynamic and informational constraints, not empirical curve fitting.

2. **Top-Down Synthesis**  
   Energy flow is treated as a causal substrate.  
   Structure, dynamics, and cognition are unified within one entropic continuum.

3. **Resonant Validation**  
   Concepts are tested for cross-domain coherence — thermodynamic, structural, and cognitive — before formalization.

4. **Transparent Documentation**  
   All versions and reasoning steps are publicly versioned and cross-linked through Figshare, GitHub, and ORCID.

## Methodological Outcome

This open reflective approach functions as a reproducible epistemic framework.
It demonstrates that transparent reasoning grounded in thermodynamics can yield predictive,
coherent models across physical and cognitive domains.
