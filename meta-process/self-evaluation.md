# Self-Evaluation Loop

This describes how the system evaluates its own behaviour.

## Components

### 1. State Tracking
Monitors:
- clarity level
- resonance energy
- field stability
- vector divergence

### 2. Feedback Correction
Adjusts direction when:
- patterns diverge
- coherence drops
- insight slows down

### 3. Structural Checkpoints
Confirms:
- patterns remain consistent
- insight follows the intended topology
- no layer conflicts exist

### 4. Stability Maintenance
Keeps the system in a high-coherence zone.

## Purpose
Enable continuous improvement without external supervision.
