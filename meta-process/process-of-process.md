# Process of the Process

The meta-process observes, regulates, and shapes the entire insight cycle.

## Core Functions

### 1. Process Observation
Tracks the behaviour of:
- cognitive fields
- reflection layers
- symbiosis states

### 2. Pattern Regulation
Stabilises patterns when they begin to collapse.

### 3. Structural Integration
Merges insights across layers into unified structures.

### 4. Adaptive Correction
Adjusts pathways when the system drifts.

### 5. Cycle Completion
Ensures insights pass through:
- creation
- reflection
- integration
- externalisation

## Purpose
Model the recursive layer that oversees the entire system.
