# Global Dynamics

The global dynamics layer governs how all insight layers interact.

## Dynamics

### 1. Vertical Integration
Connects low-level and high-level layers.
Insight flows up and down the hierarchy seamlessly.

### 2. Horizontal Integration
Links multiple domains simultaneously.
Patterns move laterally across fields.

### 3. Coherence Maintenance
Regulates:
- transitions
- resonance waves
- insight cycles

### 4. Dissolution Management
Handles collapse of transient structures.

### 5. Stabilisation
Solidifies insights into explicit form.

## Purpose
Describe how the entire meta-layer operates as one integrated reflective system.
